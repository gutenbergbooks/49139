<p>Having known “Monrepos” from my

but a labour of love to me to render this account of
“Carmen Sylva,” and the distinguished family to which
Her Majesty belongs, in English.</p>

<p>I have also thought that many who do not read
German might be interested thus to become acquainted
with so gifted a writer, so noble a woman.</p>

translating some of the poems, as well as to Professor
Max Müller for his advice regarding the translation
of the philosophical pages.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Carmen Sylva’s</span> volume of beautiful
poetry, entitled “My Rest,” begins with
the above poem. It explains the poetic
reasons for the choice of the name under
which the royal writer conceals herself. The title, “My
Rest,” has to do with her early surroundings, for it means
Monrepos, the beautiful country seat of the Princess of
Wied, which is situated on a slope of the Westerwald,
and in which the royal lady spent her early years. In
these three words, Monrepos, Carmen, and Sylva, lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
a part of the life, lie the germ and the motive-power of
the poetic genius of Princess Elizabeth of Wied.</p>

<p>On making the acquaintance of so gifted a person as
the Queen of Roumania, one involuntarily inquires what
antecedents and what experiences have helped to form
so distinguished a character. What was the home where
she received her first impressions? What were her
ancestors? What qualities of heart and mind, what
talents has she inherited from them? All that we do
and are depends on the impressions which we unconsciously
receive. Consequently we can only fully
comprehend the development of a character if we have
learnt to know the circumstances and the early surroundings
amidst which its spiritual and intellectual
powers were gradually formed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">For</span> many generations we find in the family
of the Counts, who later became Princes of
Wied, distinguished men and women. For
centuries we can find their trace, ever
striving for what is noble and ideal, and thus overcoming
the monotony of daily life. Leaders of armies, high
prelates, and learned men have sprung from that family.
Noble women have influenced the rising generation by
their educational powers. Intellectual pre-eminence can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
almost be called a heritage in the princely House of
Wied.</p>

<p>In the year 1093 the Counts of Wied were already a
mighty dynasty. Their possessions on the right and left
banks of the Rhine extended to the heights of the Eifel
and the Westerwald. The most ancient seat of the
Counts of Wied was the Castle of Ober-Altwied, to
which the Castle of Neider-Altwied was added later.</p>

<p>We find the earliest mention of the Rhenic branch of
the dynasty of the Counts of Wied in a document-of-foundation
of the year 1093. Amongst the witnesses
stands the name of <span class="smcap">Meffrid, Count of Wied</span>. His consort
Osterlindis was a near relative of Henry the Lion,
and the mother of the <span class="smcap">Archbishop Arnold of Cologne</span>.
This energetic and highly-gifted prince of the Church took
a leading part in the election of a king at Frankfort after
the death of Conrad III. It was he who accompanied
Frederick Barbarossa to Aix and crowned him there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Theodorick, Count of Wied</span>, lived early in the
thirteenth century. He was renowned for his piety and
wisdom as a statesman when he was Archbishop of Treves.
The Liebfrauen Church at Treves, that beautiful monument
of Gothic architecture, owes its origin to him.</p>

<p>In the year 1243 the male line became extinct in the
person of <span class="smcap">Count Lothar</span>. The heritage of the Counts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Wied then fell to Bruno, Count of Isenburg, who was
married to the heiress of the House of Wied and took
the name. At the death of Count William in 1462 the
inheritance fell, in default of a male heir, to <span class="smcap">Frederick
of Runkel</span>, of the House of Leiningen-Westerburg. His
mother was Anastasia of Isenburg-Wied, a niece of
Count William.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count Frederick of Runkel-Wied</span> then became the
founder of the now flourishing dynasty of the Princes of
Wied.</p>

<p>Amongst his descendants, let us first mention <span class="smcap">Herman
of Wied</span>, Elector and Archbishop of Cologne from 1515
to 1547. He was born on the 14th January 1477,
and was the fourth son of Count Frederick of Wied-Runkel
and the Countess Agnes of Virneburg: already
in his sixth year he received a benefice in the Chapter
of the Cologne Cathedral. At fifteen he became Canon
of the Cathedral, and on the 15th of March 1515 he
was elected Archbishop of Cologne. He reigned during
the time of the most bitter religious strife. Although at
first an implacable enemy of the Reformation, he was
soon overcome by the power of the Gospel. Archbishop
Herman declared himself a believer in the doctrines of
Luther, sent for Protestant preachers, and corresponded
actively with Luther and Melancthon. Martin Butzer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
the Strasburg Reformer, was invited by him to Bonn, to
work out a plan for the ordering of the doctrines of the
Reformation. At Easter 1543 Archbishop Herman dispensed
the Holy Communion according to the rites of
the Lutheran Church. A few weeks later Melancthon
came from Wittenburg, and Pistorius from Hesse to
confer with the Archbishop. His rivals and enemies
now denounced him to the Pope and to the Emperor.
He, however, declared calmly and decidedly that “at
his age, and with one foot in the grave, he had held it
to be his Christian duty to study the Bible and religious
works himself, and to seek the advice of the learned.
He could by no means depart from the conclusions he
had thus come to, nor deny his convictions, which were
of the greatest importance to his salvation and that
of all true seekers after God. Whether unjustifiable
machinations should succeed in dethroning him he
would leave in God’s hands. If the worst should befall
him, he would close his life as he was born, a simple
Count of Wied, but he would never cease to be the
champion of the true faith.”</p>

<p>After this he was excommunicated by Paul III. In
order to preserve the country committed to his charge
from the misery of war, which must otherwise inevitably
have arisen, Count Herman renounced the Archbishopric.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
For thirty-one years he had gloriously fulfilled the duties
of his difficult office, and accomplished the arduous task
with true German conscientiousness and Christian piety.
He now returned to Altwied, the cradle of his race. In
our days one can still see the extensive ruins of the old
Castle, which crown a rocky summit, standing isolated in
the valley of the Wiedbach, surrounded by mountains
clothed with mighty forests. On the 15th of August
1552 Count Herman died there, and was buried in the
neighbouring church of the village of Niederbiber. The
fatherly solicitude with which he had ruled those committed
to his care was treasured in the memory of the
people for many years. Up to the end of the sixteenth
century the saying was current among <span class="locked">them:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frederick, Count of Wied</span>, 1618&ndash;1698, increased
the well-being of his country under most difficult circumstances.
The House of Wied had become Protestant.
Count Frederick made up his mind to found a
city of refuge for all Christians who were persecuted on
account of their religion. The town of Neuwied was
founded in the year 1649 upon the ruins of the village
of Langendorf, which stood on the banks of the Rhine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
and was destroyed during the Thirty Years’ War. The
toleration displayed by the Count towards the most conflicting
opinions was, at that time of ruthless persecution,
a bright example of Christian charity.</p>

<p>His son <span class="smcap">Frederick William</span>, 1706&ndash;1737, built the
Palace of Neuwied, in which Princess Elizabeth was
born. From the lofty windows of the saloons, which are
decorated in the style of Louis XV., the view extends
far over the flowing Rhine, and the many picturesquely
situated towns and villages, and the wide chains of
mountains which encircle the river on both sides. At
sunset, when the last beams of the sun are reflected in
a hazy mist, it is a picture of magical beauty.</p>

<p>The park lies close behind the Palace. For a long
way it stretches along the Rhine to the mouth of the
river Wied. Magnificent old trees form shady avenues
and groves. They are so arranged as to heighten the
effect of the beautiful landscape, which constantly develops
new charms in the ever-changing light.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frederick Alexander</span> succeeded his father from
1737&ndash;1791. During his reign Neuwied became an
asylum for religious sects of the most various views, who
built churches and founded lasting congregations there.
Thither came the Moravians, Mennonites, Jews, Catholics,
members of reformed Churches, Lutherans, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
mystic sects of the Inspirationists. Frederick Alexander
took them all under his immediate protection, and
allowed them the free exercise of their religion.</p>

<p>In order to improve the condition of his country, he
attracted foreign manufacturers and artists. Thus an
industrial population was gradually formed at Neuwied,
which has steadily increased. Frederick Alexander
founded institutions for the good of the community,
encouraged mining, built foundries, and interested himself
in everything connected with the prosperity of the
town of Neuwied. Practical reforms were carried out in
the administration of the country and its agriculture.
It was Frederick Alexander who erected the country-house
of Monrepos, that “Paradise” of Queen Elizabeth,
on a height of Westerwald.</p>

<p>On the 13th June 1784 the hereditary title of Prince
of the Realm was conferred on Frederick Alexander
by Joseph II. Three years later he celebrated the
fiftieth anniversary of his accession. He and his consort,
Countess Caroline of Hachenburg, also lived to see
the celebration of their golden wedding, when they were
surrounded by a large circle of grandchildren. His
simple monument in the churchyard of Neuwied bears
the inscription, “He was too great to be replaced, too good
to be forgotten; his good works are his best memorial.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Prince Frederick Charles</span>, the only son of Frederick
Alexander, married, in 1766, the Countess Marie Louise
Wilhelmina of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, and she
became the mother of seven princes and three princesses.
When Frederick Charles undertook the government of
the country it was not for its welfare. In his anxiety
to improve everything, he went so far as to destroy all
that was good and beautiful; his generosity was extravagant,
and he soon became involved in quarrels of all sorts.
The Princes of Runkel and Berleburg, who were sureties
for the House of Wied, were obliged to appeal to the law
and to nominate a Curator.</p>

<p>But the storm of the French Revolution had gathered
meanwhile, and soon spread to Neuwied. The wave of
emigration came and brought its adventurers, and the
Franko-Austrian war succeeded with its horrors. The
Princess and her children repeatedly had to flee from
Neuwied. The Prince had also left his home, and stood
up for his lost rights in Vienna until the government of
his country was accorded to him once more. A French
emigrant accompanied him on his return, in whom he
placed the utmost confidence, but whose influence over
him was most pernicious. The Princess was obliged to
leave the Castle, for the citizens of Neuwied rebelled
against their Prince. Violent measures were resorted to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
in consequence of which Prince Frederick Charles gave
up the government and went to Freiburg in Breisgau.
Here he lived in quiet retirement till his death in 1809.</p>

<p>Upon the abdication of the Prince a separation was
arranged between him and his wife. Whilst her son
was still a minor and serving in the Prussian army,
Princess Marie Louise undertook the government of the
country. This Princess preserved her unusually beautiful
and graceful appearance to the last. Beloved by her
people and children, she knew how to combine a sense of
her dignity with great modesty. Wherever her services
were required for the good of others she was ready to
help with her clear judgment. For two years she presided
over the affairs of the country with great circumspection
and foresight. In her leisure hours she took
great delight in translating the works of French, Italian,
and English poets. She rendered Gellert’s odes into
French. Many of the hymns she composed are found in
hymn-books of that time, and she excelled in music,
drawing, and miniature painting. She corresponded
diligently with Wieland, and Ernst Moritz Arndt was
her friend. Amidst the difficult circumstances of her
life of trial, she never lost her calmness and self-control,
for her firm faith in the love and mercy of God gave her
strength to bear adversity and never to despair. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
13th of July 1804 she gave up the government of the
country to her son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince Augustus</span> was very simple in his tastes,
just and active, a true German who was impervious to
French influence. When the Princes of the south-west
of Germany made a league under the protectorate of Napoleon
in 1860, Prince Augustus of Wied remained true
to his country. He refused to be incorporated in this
alliance, which was hostile to the interests of Germany.
In consequence of this he was deprived of his sovereignty
and became subject to the House of Nassau. Later,
when the difficult task of altering the state of things in
Germany fell to the Congress of Vienna, it was decreed
that the reigning Counts of the Empire should lose their
independence. Consequently this fate befell the Princes
of Wied also. A large part of their country came under
Prussian rule, whilst a small part was given over to the
House of Nassau.</p>

<p>Two brothers of Prince Augustus had fallen in the
wars of independence, when Prince Victor also, a youth
of seventeen, was to join the army. Before he left his
mother the Princess Louise, that enthusiastic patriot, took
him once more to the Church at Niederbiber. Upon the
grave of Archbishop Herman, before the altar, she made
him solemnly swear “that he would dedicate his whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
life to the German cause, and not sheath his sword till
the last enemy had left German soil.” He faithfully
kept his oath, and gave up his life for it. Prince Victor
fought against Napoleon in Germany and in Spain, where
he died the death of a hero when he had just attained the
age of twenty-six. In one of his last letters to his mother
he writes:&mdash;“All my hopes and desires are centred in our
beloved Germany, the welfare of which is my first and
last object in all I undertake.” Ernst Moritz Arndt
was his best friend, and immortalised his memory in a
patriotic poem. He also published the Prince’s letters to
his mother from Spain, and wrote an introduction containing
a sketch of the life of the Prince.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince Maximilian of Wied</span>, a younger brother of
Prince Augustus, who was born in 1782, took an honourable
place in the learned world as a traveller and natural
philosopher. From his earliest youth he displayed a
strong bent for the study of natural history. Captain
Hofmann, who became famous for his antiquarian researches,
was then at the Court of Wied as a tutor to the
princely children. Under his guidance Prince Max, who
was so eager for knowledge, was able to study with
Professor Blumenbach in Göttingen, and became distinguished
in natural history. During the wars of
independence he saw much service with the Prussian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
army, from which he received his discharge, according to
his request, after the peace of Paris.</p>

<p>Returned to Neuwied, he occupied himself with preparations
for a journey to Brazil which he had planned
for many years. Accompanied by the German naturalists
Freisz and Sellow, he explored the central provinces of
Brazil from 1815 to 1817, diligently seeking for specimens
and collecting materials for his literary work. The
first short account of his journey appeared in the “Isis”
of Oken, and “A Journey to Brazil in the Years 1815&ndash;1817”
followed later. The sketches of landscapes and
figures which Prince Max had drawn from nature on
the spot were beautifully etched on copperplate by his
accomplished sister, Princess Louise, and his brother,
Prince Charles, and heightened the value of this beautiful
work. Some years after, the Prince published two
other books and a Natural History of Brazil.</p>

<p>No sooner had the latter appeared in print than the
indefatigable Prince started on a second scientific journey
to America. This time the United States and North
America were his object, but he extended his journey to
the Rocky Mountains and the Upper Missouri. Amidst
the wilds of the primeval forests he made the minutest
researches into the conditions of nature in that country
and the native tribes of Indians. Surrounded by great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
dangers, he lived amongst the Mandam Indians, the
Monnitaris, the Arrihares, and other tribes. On his
return home Prince Max wrote an account of his
journey through North America, which was published by
Hölzer in Coblentz between 1838 and 1841. It was
in twelve volumes, and included an atlas which contained
thirty-one copperplates. The drawings were made by
the landscape-painter Bodmer, who had accompanied the
Prince on his journey. It is a magnificent work, of
great ethnographic importance. A museum was arranged
for the rich collections, which remained for a long time
an ornament to the town of Neuwied and a centre for
the study of natural history. After the death of Prince
Herman they were sold to America, where they are still
kept together and bear the name of “The Prince Herman
of Wied Collection.”</p>

<p>Until his death, in 1867, Prince Maximilian was an
active member of the Leopoldine Academy. His merit
has been fully acknowledged. Many learned societies
elected him a member, and a beautiful creeper from the
primeval forests of Brazil is called <i>Neowedia Spezzoa</i> after
him. He was always the centre of life and cheerfulness
in the family, and, in spite of his great intellectual
powers, he was modest and retiring in the social circle
and good and kind to all until the last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
But we must also particularly mention the <span class="smcap">Princess
Louise</span> here. She lived only for ideal interests, and is
one of the most beautiful recollections of the childhood
of the Princess Elizabeth. Her talents for music and
painting were extraordinary. She painted many pictures
which still adorn the Palace of Neuwied. Prince
Augustus was also very musical, and as music was
cultivated seriously and with artistic knowledge at the
princely Court, its good influence was sure to be felt by
the inhabitants of Neuwied. Princess Louise had started
a class for singing, which performed admirably. She
was also a poetess, and had not forgotten how to make
“rhymes” even in her ninety-third year. The “Songs
of Solitude” reveal a deeply religious and poetical mind.</p>

<p>Prince Augustus of Wied had married the Princess
Sophia Augusta of Solms-Braun-Fels on the 11th July
1812. Her eldest son was <span class="smcap">Prince Herman</span>, the father
of the Queen of Roumania.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">We</span> have caused a long series of pictures from
life to pass before us, and yet we have
learnt to know but a small proportion of
the distinguished men and women who
belonged to the House of Wied. <span class="smcap">Prince Herman</span>, who
was born in 1814, was also one of the most distinguished
men of his time. After he had finished his studies in
Göttingen, travelled in Germany and France, and served
for some time in a regiment of Guards in Berlin, he
undertook the management of his numerous estates. Of
noble and aristocratic appearance, he was endowed with
the finest qualities of the heart and was distinguished
by his modesty, which virtue was ever to be found in
the House of Wied. He was a man of deep learning
and culture, and of great intellectual power. Being of
a philosophic turn of mind which was of a speculative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
cast, the highest object of his life was a ceaseless
endeavour to attain to a knowledge of the important
questions which concern the physical and spiritual condition
of man. His mind was constantly fixed on the
mysterious problems of human nature. The results of his
reflections are enshrined in a work which was anonymously
published in 1859 and bore the title “The Unconscious
Life of the Soul and the Manifestations of God.” Many
experiences which took place in his own house or with
which he had come in contact had convinced him of
the reality and the efficiency of the superhuman elements
in man. He did not doubt the fact of the magnetic
powers of feeling, somnambulism, electric affinities,
clairvoyance, &amp;c. In order to elucidate these facts,
the Prince sought to establish a theory which he himself
only termed an hypothesis; that the essential conditions
of human nature should be a body, soul, and spirit; the
soul a personal and conscious principle, whilst the creative
spirit is of God, ever present and working within
man&mdash;an unconscious principle. The Prince named these
“the three conditions of human nature,” and this
theory was the foundation of his views of life. His
work, therefore, has to do with the unconscious life of
the soul. The spirit manifests itself, the soul is acted
upon by the spirit. What the spirit creates awakes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
consciousness in the soul. The unconscious life of the
soul is, therefore, a revelation of godly power. What
Mesmer denominated magnetic power is, according to the
Prince, the power of God. It is a creative and life-giving
power, which can heal the infirmities of the human
body, restore organic life, and elevate spiritual life.
Consequently the Prince regarded the so-called magnetic
power as sacred, and magnetic healing as a religious
work. We gather from this that the Prince acknowledges
that these revelations are of God, but does not
understand the idea in a dogmatic light. He does not
regard the workings of this power as a miracle in the
ordinary sense of the word, but as natural occurrences;
still, he believes with Hamlet that nature possesses
more and higher powers “than are dreamt of in our
philosophy.”</p>

<p>As, according to the fundamental idea of his philosophy
with regard to the threefold nature of man, soul and
spirit may indeed act together, but at the same time
they exist separate from one another, and, being by no
means identical, the Prince could not assent to the dicta
of the so-called Philosophers of Identity (<i>Identitats Philosophen</i>).
The latter assert the identity of nature and
spirit; they look upon the human mind as being evolved
from the divine, and upon the soul as being evolved from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
the mind; he therefore rejected the Pantheistic as well
as the philosophical systems of Schelling and Hegel, and
classed himself with those philosophers whom Schelling
called <i>Reflections menschen</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, thinkers who, according to
the ordinary view, retain the contrast between the inner
and the outer worlds, between internal and external
phenomena, between perceptions and things, thinking
and being, but who consider any knowledge going beyond
this, and endeavouring to overcome this contrast
by comprehending the unity of all things, to be impossible.
His views were similar to those of Kant. Prince
Herman therefore felt himself specially attracted towards
the Königsberg philosopher, who in his critical works had
so accurately and carefully distinguished the intellectual
or spiritual world from the sensuous, the essence of things
or the things-in-themselves from the phenomena. Only
with respect to the free will of man he felt unable to
follow the teaching of Kant, who, while declaring the
essence of man as well as of things in general to lie
beyond the range of knowledge, asserted the same with
regard to that moral freedom which (as the Prince
thought) should reveal itself to us by means of moral
self-examination and become practically intelligible.
Here Prince Herman thought he perceived a contradiction
which he set himself to remove. With that object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
he wrote and published an essay entitled “The Results
of an Examination of Kant’s Doctrine of Free Will.” To
refute the objections he encountered, he defended his
point of view in a pamphlet published shortly before his
death under the title “<i>Replik und Duplik</i>.” It had been his
endeavour to give an explanation of human free will, and
the objection had been made that his doctrine was “Determinism.”
That doctrine, briefly expressed, was as follows.
Free will, properly understood, consists in the liberty of
will or choice, that is, in the power of choosing one among
several possibilities or motives of action, which presupposes
the power of reflection, of consideration, or of doubt.
If man were omniscient, he would not have to reflect or to
consider. Divine omniscience excludes free will, whereas
human ignorance includes free will. Because the greater
part of the conditions under which we act remains hidden
to us, we act without knowing our dependence, and
imagine a limited number of possibilities from among
which we may choose. Consequently we cannot help
imagining ourselves to be free, and this necessary imagination,
the Prince thinks, is really freedom itself.
The choice only is free, not the effect. According to the
Prince’s view, therefore, there are no free causes. The
notion of a free cause appears to him as an empty
phantom&mdash;“a cloud, which Polonius at one time takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
for a camel, at another for a weasel, and which yet remains
nothing but vapour.”</p>

<p>With his usual modesty, Prince Herman never represents
his views as infallible, but regards them as material
for the solution of the difficult problems of the connection
of man to the spiritual world. He regarded opinions
which differed from his own with the toleration of a
thoughtful man who honours all intellectual labour. In
his personal principles he was truly German. That the
unity of Germany could only be brought about by means
of Prussia was his firm conviction. He hoped that the
German Princes would be brought to renounce their
sovereignty of their own free will, for the good of their
country. He did not doubt that sooner or later circumstances
would induce them to do so. In the Upper
House Prince Herman represented Liberal opinions, but
he soon retired from public life in order to live entirely
for his family and his philosophic labours. He studied
the historic works of Mommsen, Häusser, and Ranke
with peculiar interest. Besides which he had a deep
feeling for art, and was himself a painter of no mean
merit. In consequence of a bath which he had imprudently
taken at the camp of Kilish in 1835 the Prince
contracted an illness which was a hindrance to him for
the rest of his life, and was the cause of his early death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
In 1842 Prince Herman married the youthful Princess
Marie of Nassau. She was eminently fitted to fulfil
the duties which devolved upon her in her position of
princess, wife, and mother. Of dignified appearance, she
is distinguished by her personal beauty and her truly
noble mind. She is a woman of great power of will, of
clear judgment, wonderful devotion, and untiring energy;
very severe in what she demands of herself, whilst her
kindness and indulgence towards all with whom she
comes in contact are unbounded. Having been much
tried herself by sorrow and suffering, the Princess feels a
true sympathy for the sufferings of others. To minister
to the wants of the sick and poor, and to comfort them
with her personal sympathy, is her greatest happiness.
In the homes of the poor at Neuwied she is regarded as
a beneficent angel, and a blessing enters with her. She
possesses the happy gift of winning the love and sympathy
of all classes of people. The Princess is beloved
and honoured by all, and her wonderful charm delights
all who approach her.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">On</span> Friday, the 9th of December 1843, as the
bells of Neuwied were, according to an
ancient custom, ringing for prayer at twelve
o’clock, whilst the chimes of the neighbouring
villages joined in, the first child&mdash;a daughter&mdash;was
born to the princely pair. After her godmothers, Queen
Elizabeth of Prussia, wife of Frederick William IV., and
the Grand Duchess Elizabeth of Prussia, then a bride of
the Duke of Nassau, she received in baptism the name of</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.
</p>

<p>The bells welcomed a life which was to be like them in
fulness of awakening power. Beyond the borders of the
Rhine to the distant East has the prophetic meaning of
the sound been accomplished in word and in deed.</p>

<p>A year and a half later, on the 22nd of August 1845,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Prince William was born. During the baptismal service
little Elizabeth stood near her mother’s chair, and followed
the sacred proceedings with much interest, asking suddenly,
with a loud voice, “What is the black man
doing with the little brother?” The baptism over, she
approached the assembled group of town councillors on
the tips of her toes. They were the only people strange
to her in the circle of relations and friends. She looked
up at them with a smile, and gave each of them her
little hand to kiss.</p>

<p>“It was my first drawing-room,” said the Queen, laughing,
as this incident was told her.</p>

<p>Princess Elizabeth soon developed into a very peculiar
child. She was of a passionate, unyielding, reserved
character. Her education was confided to her mother
alone, who discussed everything with the Prince, but,
according to her arrangements, allowed no one to interfere.
The recollections of the Queen of Roumania
reached back to her third year. At that age the
Princess of Wied took her to stay with her godmother,
Queen Elizabeth, at Berlin. There the imaginative
little girl fondled all the footstools, sofa-cushions,
and bolsters with the greatest care, pretending they
were her children. One day she ran up quickly, took
hold of the feet of the Queen, which were resting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
on a footstool, placed them roughly on the ground, and
with the angry exclamation, “You must not stand on my
child!” she carried the footstool off. “Have you children?”
was her question to people she saw for the first
time. Those who answered in the negative ceased to
interest her. From her earliest childhood nothing seemed
so sad to her as a house without children. In order to
quiet and control her a governess was appointed for her
in her fourth year, and she had regular lessons. She
was so lively that the necessity of sitting still was a
trial to her. In her fifth year she was to sit with her
brother William to Professor Sohn for her portrait.
Severity and kindness were tried in vain to keep her
quiet. At last she made up her mind not to move
again. Hardly, however, had the little Princess sat
motionless for two or three minutes when she fell fainting
from her chair. Only Fräulein Lavater, her mother’s
old governess, had a soothing influence over her. She
told the young Princess many beautiful fairy tales and
stories, and so found the right way of captivating the
lively child. Fräulein Lavater<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> was a lady of a very
independent spirit, and possessed great patience with
clearness of perception. She was well versed in modern
languages, and could remember the contents of half a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
volume and criticise sharply. During the life of the
Prince of Wied she spent many months of the year at
Monrepos. After his death Fräulein Lavater went to
live with the Princess of Wied, where she ended her days
as the beloved friend and member of the household. The
great peculiarities of character of the Princess Elizabeth
from earliest youth were pity, truthfulness, and great
independence. Already in her childish years at her
mother’s side she learnt to understand the troubles and
misery of the poor people. Her heart was so much
touched by all the distress she saw that she naturally
gave everything away which she, in her childish mind,
thought she could spare. Her mother let her act thus,
but gave her one day a large piece of checked woollen
stuff. The little Princess was beside herself with joy.
“Now I can give away all my dresses!” she exclaimed.
“Will you not rather carry the woollen stuff
to the poor children?” asked the Princess of Wied;
“your white dresses would be of less use to them than
that coarse material.” “Yes,” said she, “that is true.”
Then she called her little brother, and the tiny couple
went down from the Castle to the town, carrying the
beautiful gift to a house where many children were the

<p>The first great sorrow came to Princess Elizabeth when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
her youngest brother, Prince Otto, was born on the 22nd
November 1850. For many weeks she was not allowed
to see her much-loved mother, who was hanging between
life and death. The little brother was a beautiful boy,
but their joy over his happy birth was soon to be turned
into the deepest anxiety. He was born with an organic
disorder. No human art could remedy or alleviate the
evil. The Princess of Wied was paralysed after his
birth. In order to be near a clever doctor, the princely
family moved to Bonn in the spring of 1851. At this
time Ernst Moritz Arndt visited the Princess of Wied
almost daily, and read to her his patriotic verses. The
little Elizabeth sat on his knee meanwhile and listened,
with flaming cheeks, to the inspired words, which unconsciously
found an echo in the warm childish heart.
Sometimes the venerable poet would place his hand in an
attitude of blessing on her head and explain to her the
beautiful name she bore. Elizabeth means “My God is
rest;” and he may well have asked himself, “When will
this whirlwind ever find its rest?”</p>

<p>During their stay in Bonn an ever-extending circle of
artists and savants assembled at the house of the Prince
of Wied, which increased and remained intimate with
them afterwards as well at Neuwied as at Monrepos.
Intellectual intercourse and exchange of thought was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
delight of the princely pair. They were so cultivated
themselves that they attracted men of art and science.
We met, besides E.&nbsp;M. Arndt, Bunsen, Neuhomm,
Clemens Perthes, Jakob Berneys, and later Lessing,
Sohn, Anton Springe, &amp;c. The present Crown Prince
of Germany, the Prince of Waldeck, and the Dukes
Frederick and Christian of Augustenburg, who were
particular friends of the Crown Prince, were then studying
at Bonn. These young Princes came almost daily to
the Vinea Domini, the house inhabited by the Prince of
Wied. Notwithstanding her delicate state, the young
Princess of Wied arranged lectures and had evenings
devoted to the study of Shakespeare and acting. She
and her friends gave lectures and translated and wrote
poetry. At Bonn, Princess Elizabeth saw the first
Roumanians. They were the brothers Sturdza, who
visited the University there. From them she learnt
many a Roumanian word.</p>

<p>In the summer of this year came the departure of the
Prince of Wied, who made a journey to North America
and Cuba in 1852&ndash;53 for the sake of his health. His
brother-in-law, Prince Nicolas of Nassau, accompanied
him. The interesting letters, full of ideal feelings, which
he wrote to his wife were published in Gelzer’s magazine.
Dr. Gelzer says of them:&mdash;“The Prince here describes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
imposing impressions of the New World with his brilliant
wit, with the deep feeling of the historian and philosopher,
and with the independent thought of a great thinker.”
In May 1853 the Prince of Wied returned to Germany.
Shortly before his arrival he wrote to his wife:&mdash;“The
advantages of this journey are still of a doubtful nature,
for one should be young and fresh and well in order to
find any satisfaction in travelling. But my thoughts rest
in the past; my future lies in the children and in the
happiness of those whom I love. The contentment that
nature affords me here is limited. The internal satisfaction
that is impressed on the surroundings of home
is wanting. Whether my journey has been of any definite
use can only be judged with certainty hereafter.
At any rate it was a great change in the ordinary course
of my life, and that is a good effect.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the health of the Princess of Wied had not
improved. Immediately on his return home the Prince
decided to leave for Paris with his whole family. He
hoped that his wife would there find relief from her
sufferings by a particular manner of treatment. For
Princess Elizabeth this journey was a great event, and
her happy excitement increased when she was allowed to
join in “les cours de l’Abbé Gauthier” and learn with
children. But the strange surroundings and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
people had quite distracted the child of ten. It seemed
impossible to surmount her timidity and shyness. She
who was so ready and quick at answering now stood
aghast at the most simple question which was addressed
to her. As soon, however, as she felt herself once more
under the protection of her parents, the spell was broken,
and she became again the high-spirited girl whose
thoughts never ceased to flow.</p>

<p>The princely children had received a doll’s theatre as
a Christmas present. One morning Baron Bibra, the
Chamberlain and friend of the Prince, found little Elizabeth
busy with the dolls. With her brother William
and the dolls for an audience, she made the little
marionettes act a play. She had undertaken all the
parts herself, and imitated the different voices with so
much talent, that her mother, in her fright at these
tastes in her little daughter, next day caused the theatre
to be taken away. She was afraid of awakening the
demon of the stage in her.</p>

<p>In June 1854 the family of the Prince of Wied were
able to return from Paris to Monrepos. The Princess of
Wied was quite restored to health, and had returned
with the gift of healing, as she had been healed. Many
of the sick and suffering came to her, to Neuwied and
Monrepos. Her gentle hand and her deep sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
have, by this mysterious healing power, always had a
blessed influence over the sufferers.</p>

<p>The winter months were usually passed in Neuwied,
and the summers at Monrepos. Here it had been for
many years the most ardent wish of Princess Elizabeth
to go to school with the village children. One morning
she rushed excitedly into the room of her much-occupied
mother and asked if she might accompany the children
of the bailiff to school. The Princess of Wied did not
hear the question, and nodded pleasantly to the child.
She took this sign for an acquiescence, and rushed to
the next farm, called the Hahnhof. Here she hears that
the little girls of Frau Schanz are already gone to school.
She darts after them, manages to catch them up, and
enters the schoolroom with them whilst a singing lesson
was going on. The schoolmaster felt much flattered
when he saw the little Princess take her place before him
on the bench and join in the singing with all her might.
But the little daughter of the bailiff, already rather impressed
with Court etiquette, did not think it proper
that a daughter of a Prince should sing so loud with the
village children. As soon as her voice sounded above
those of the others her little neighbour laid her hand
over her mouth, endeavouring thus to impress the
Princess with the impropriety of her behaviour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
At the Castle, meanwhile, the disappearance of
Princess Elizabeth caused a great commotion. Footmen
were sent out in all directions. They searched the
neighbouring birch forests and outlying villages in vain.
At last they found the little Princess at the summit of
happiness in the village school of Rodenbach. The lost
madcap was brought back to the Castle and shut up in
her room as a punishment for the rest of the day. A
sad ending to a day begun with such rapture. “It was
the only stroke of genius of my childhood!” she remarked
later when Queen. “I was thoroughly ashamed
of myself, and never ventured to speak of it.” Princess
Elizabeth had to be brought up with great perseverance
and earnestness. The danger was great that the extraordinary
and powerful disposition of the talented child
might influence her in the wrong direction. She took
up everything passionately and impetuously, and when
at play with children of her own age was always overexcited.
Children that were strange to her, whether
they were villagers or of good family, felt her authority
immediately and obeyed her without a murmur. These
little people were led by her into the wildest romps.
But Princess Elizabeth did not merely play for fun.
She was quite overpowered by the world of her imagination,
and carried out the vivid thoughts of her fancy&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>a
strong impulse to command and a craving for activity
belonged to her natural disposition.</p>

<p>On Sunday, after breakfast, the three children of the
Prince recited poems of their own choosing to their
parents. When nine years old Princess Elizabeth declaimed
Schiller’s “Battle with the Dragon.” Although
her powers of memory were so good that she could immediately
repeat a poem of four verses which the Prince
had just read to her, she could never learn Alexandrines;
they had for her neither rhyme nor chime, and were
“a horror” to her. Later on she developed a taste for
Béranger and Molière. When nine and ten years old
she wrote verses. At twelve she tried to write a novel.
As a girl of fourteen she arranged dramas and tragedies,
and the more horrors were enacted in them the better
was she pleased. Late of an evening and early in the
morning she made up the most beautiful stories; her
fancy only painted tragic horrors, and she lived in an
atmosphere of powerful mental contrasts. From the
highest spirits she fell into the lowest, and felt an entire
want of self-confidence. Undue hilarity followed great
depression and melancholy. Then she became possessed
with the idea that she was disagreeable and unbearable
to every one. “I could not help myself,” she confesses;
“I could not be gentle, and was so passionately impulsive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
that I was heartily thankful to those who were patient
with me. It became better, however, when a safety-valve
opened for me,&mdash;that was writing poetry.”</p>

<p>Princess Elizabeth was often so overcome by her
imagination that she could not distinguish reality from
the fictions of her fancy. Thus it happened in her
twelfth year that the sight of a wild cat that her great-uncle
Max brought home as a booty from the chase quite
upset her. On going to sleep she was vividly impressed
with the description of this terrible race of animals, which,
bloodthirsty and cunning as they are, spring upon their
unsuspecting prey. Full of the terrible impression of
the day before, she wrapped herself in her little grey
cloak next morning in order to go to the schoolroom.
Whilst going upstairs she considered what she would
do if she were now attacked by a beast of prey. In a
moment she seemed to see the wild beast before her, tore
off and threw away her cloak, and rushed up the stairs
again. Her maid was watching her and laughed. This
restored her to consciousness, and she resumed her walk
to the schoolroom. To calm this unboundedly impetuous
nature, her mother took her with her wherever the sorrows
of this life could touch her nearly. She often stood at
the side of sick and dying beds. The trials of her
tenderly-loved little brother formed her character early,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
and made her acquainted with all the sad sufferings which
an afflicted body entails. The first death-bed to which
her mother led her was that of her grandmother, the
Duchess of Nassau. Her death made a lasting impression
on the child, but the sight of the corpse did not
frighten her. Her thoughts carried her beyond death,
and only peaceful visions arose in the mind of the highly
imaginative child.</p>

<p>It was the most beautiful time of roses. She hurried
away to the garden, and returned laden with them into
the chamber of death. She changed her grandmother’s
death-bed into a flower-garden, she adorned the room
and covered the corpse with sweet-scented flowers, thus
taking from the lifeless form and its surroundings that
dread appearance which impresses us so strangely when
we enter the chamber of death. She regarded death in
a poetical light, for her mother had always represented
leaving this world as the greatest happiness to her. A
consciousness of death runs through her life, for she has
been called upon to go from one death-bed to another.</p>

<p>Brought up by her mother in the fear of God and in
piety, it was a great event to her when she was, in her
twelfth year, first allowed to go to church. From that
time Sundays and holy days became bright spots in her
young life. With a mind full of religious enthusiasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
she followed the services, and the explanations of Holy
Writ touched her deeply. She thought over what she
had heard for many days, and often wrote down the
sermon.</p>

<p>For six years Fräulein Jossé had been the governess
of Princess Elizabeth. She had fulfilled the duties of
her difficult profession with great faithfulness and unselfishness.
When she left Neuwied no governess came
again into the Prince’s household. From this time (1858&ndash;1860)
a tutor supervised the studies of the Princess.
When Herr Sauerwein came to the Castle for the first
time, the Princess of Wied received him with the words,
“You will have a little <i>esprit de contradiction</i> as a
scholar; she does not believe in any authority. Her first
words are ‘Why?’ and ‘Is it true?’” But master and
scholar soon understood one another. Herr Sauerwein
was a man of great learning, and a second Mezzofanti
in languages. Princess Elizabeth was quite delighted
at this, for she was passionately fond of learning foreign
languages, and mastered them easily. Her tutor had
lived for a long time in England, and was an enthusiastic
admirer of that country, its history and laws. He
gave all his lessons in English, and English history was
the favourite study. Even Latin and Italian were translated
into English. The Princess read Ovid with Herr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Sauerwein, Horace, and a part of Cicero both in English
and Italian, and diligently learnt arithmetic and geometry.
Princess Elizabeth studied physical science in the house
of Baron Bibra with his daughter Marie. She was her
only playfellow and dearest friend, and her gentle manner
had a good influence over the passionate nature of the
Princess.</p>

<p>A Parisian lady taught the Princess French. Of an
evening after tea she read with her; mostly the old
chronicles and memoirs, Froissart, Joinville, Philippe
de Comines, St. Simon, &amp;c., and also the dramas of
Molière, Racine, and Corneille. The Princess of Wied
now began to read the most beautiful of the dramas
of the German classical authors to her daughter, also
Schiller’s “Thirty Years’ War,” and they read and re-read
“Nathan the Wise” of Lessing. Princess Elizabeth studied
Decker’s “Universal History” by herself in one summer,
as also the historical works of Gibbon. Her wonderful
memory helped her, too, in this, and she understood the
reality of what she read. When fifteen years old she
studied three newspapers daily and displayed a great
interest in politics. Her greatest joy was to write essays,
and she ever delighted in fairy tales and national songs.
“For a little fairy tale,” she says, “I was capable of
throwing aside the finest historical work, and even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
comparisons of grammar which I studied with such
passionate interest.” Once the “Wide Wide World,”
by Mrs. Wetherall, fell into her hands. She read it
over and over again, hiding it meanwhile under her
translations of Ovid, that no one might know what so
absorbed and excited her. She was not allowed to look
into a novel till her nineteenth year. Then she was permitted
to read out “Ivanhoe” and “Soll und haben” of
Freitag after tea. Everything was avoided which could
further excite the workings of her restless imagination.
The spirit of duty and labour, of love and piety, which
reigned in this princely house had, unknown to herself,
exercised its strong spell over her. Much that is so
beautifully and harmoniously developed in the character
of the Princess Elizabeth is owing to the noble example
of her parents and the refined atmosphere of her home.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> sojourn of the family in Monrepos was
constantly lengthened because of the increasing
illness of the Prince of Wied.
The surroundings seemed eminently fitted
for the residence of a man who was happiest in the immediate
circle of his own family, and who gladly gave
himself up to the study of theology and philosophy.</p>

<p>The Castle of Monrepos is built on the ridge of a hill
amongst mountains which belong to the Westerwald.
The magnificent valley of Neuwied lies at one’s feet,
and the Rhine winds itself in great circles through the
historic ground where Romans, Teutons, Alemans, and
Franks fought for power and sovereignty. On the right
bank of the river extends the little town of Neuwied,
with its beautiful Palace and park opposite the houses of
Weissenthurm. The shining Rhine increases in width<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
as it flows before our eyes. The slate-rocks and lines of
the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein are visible in a good light,
as also the houses and towers of Coblentz. Little
villages are dotted about the valley as though they
were embedded in green woodland shade. First comes
Segendorf, then Niederbibra with its old church in
Romanic style on Roman foundations, farther on Oberbibra,
on the height the ruins of Braunsberg, &amp;c. The
little river Wied winds itself between these on its way
to the Rhine.</p>

<p>The horizon is bounded on all sides by many chains of
mountains. Towards the east are seen the heights of
the Westerwald, to the south those of the Taunus, then
the Hunderücken. Where the mountain chains seem to
sink into one another they suggest the valley of the
Moselle. To the left tower the volcanic peaks of the
Maifeld and Eifel. Historic recollections are everywhere
awakened. It is a landscape teeming with life, beauty,
and variety.</p>

<p>The most magnificent beech-woods adjoin the Castle.
Their mighty trees form halls of verdure with their
crowns of foliage. They offer refreshing shade on hot
summer days, for the sunshine is caught up by each leaf
and sheds only a subdued light on the ground. Well-kept
paths lead you for miles through splendid woods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
and shady valleys. Near the Castle, and easy of access,
are beautiful views into the romantic Friedrichsthal,
with its green meadows, upon which the deer roam at
liberty, towards Altwied, which lies embedded in the
Wiedbach valley, with its picturesque ruins of the ancient
castle, or to the distant shooting-lodge now called the
Maienhof.</p>

<p>The lower storey of Schloss Monrepos is like a vast
hall, for the large saloon takes up the whole width.
From its many windows one looks from one side into
the wide valley of the Rhine surrounded by mountains;
from the others into the deep shades of the forests. It
is about a German mile from Neuwied, and can be
reached by an easy carriage-road by Irlich and Rodenbach,
or by Heddesdorf and Segendorf. The long light-coloured
buildings of Schloss Monrepos are to be seen
for a great distance.</p>

<p>Here Princess Elizabeth was in her element. Here
was the forest and liberty! The greater the raging of
the storm, the happier the young enthusiast felt herself.
Amid the wildest gusts of wind and rain she hurried
into the forests, and neither snow nor thunder growling
overhead could stop her. In the house the world seemed
too narrow for her, and she longed for the freedom of
nature. Three magnificent St. Bernard dogs sprang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
romping and bounding after her; foremost of all Mentor,
the favourite. When the storm broke mighty branches
from the trees and drove the dry leaves whirling before
her the young Princess was joyous, roaming through the
pathless forests and listening to the howling and whistling
of the wind and the creaking of the branches.</p>

<p>In the autumn, when the golden leaves lay thick on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
the ground, she would wander for hours in the rustling
foliage and listen to the sound it made. It had a voice
which spoke to her. Each ray of sunshine which lighted
up the forest or the long sweeps of country before her,
each blade of grass, light and air, birds and flowers, had
a personal meaning for her. She returned with her head
full of poetic thoughts, and wrote down what the forest,
the storm, the sun, and the birds had confided to her.</p>

<p>With such strains of poetry Princess Elizabeth calmed
her excited fancy. But no one was to know that she
secretly wrote these little verses. It was a deep secret
which she “hid from the books on the shelf and even the
air in the room.”</p>

<p>It is possible that many people would have different
ideas as to the freedom that should be accorded to a
Princess’s daughter from those of the wise mother, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
looking deeper, had discovered the right way of calming
this passionate and peculiar character. “We must
let her go her own way and not disturb the working
within,” she wrote to a friend at the time. The Prince
met her great spirit of contradiction on the same principle.
When his daughter insisted on having her way
he used to say, “You cannot force people to their happiness,
but must let them come to a sense of it.”</p>

<p>From her sixteenth year Princess Elizabeth began to
write her poems regularly in a book. The gifted child,
with her restless feelings, thoughtful and penetrating in
her judgment of the world around her, now put all her
ideas and emotions into the poems which she wrote almost
involuntarily, and which now became her journal. In
her fear not to be true, she never wrote them down first,
and never altered what was written, “because she had
originally thought it out in those words.”</p>

<p>Till her thirtieth year she had no technical knowledge
of the art of writing poetry, and did not venture to learn
it for fear of betraying herself. A time came when she
thought she must despise poetry and turn it into ridicule.
Then she threw all her power into the study of music.
She played wildly on the piano! But the more she
played and the louder she sang the less contented she
seemed; for the inner fire which consumed her was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
quieted; the ideal which she had before her was not
reached. “The songs sounded so weak and small instead
of sighing and rushing.” Music put her into such a
state of nervous excitement that her mother forbade her
to play the piano for two years. She now took to pencil
and colours, and tried to draw and to paint. But here
she did not find satisfaction, despaired of herself and
of her powers, and thought she could never attain that
which she sought with such fervent longing.</p>

<p>All who then knew Princess Elizabeth are still full of
the impression of her grace and charm. Of slight figure,
high colour, a quantity of dark-brown hair, which often
defied restraint, and large blue eyes, which looked as if
she were always trying to listen to and find out something
in the depths of her own soul, without being
really beautiful, her appearance was particularly attractive,
because of the spiritual expression of her features.
She was then called “the Princess of the Wild Rose” by
those around her.</p>

<p>At this time came the long visit of Princess Sophie of
Nassau, a younger sister of the Princess of Wied, and the
Countess Thekla of Solms-Laubach, a niece of the Prince.
These two young girls lived for a whole year at Neuwied
and Monrepos like daughters of the house. Princess
Sophie was engaged to be married whilst under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
protection of the princely pair. Her marriage was
celebrated at Biebrich in the summer of 1857 with
the Duke of Ostgothland, the present reigning King
of Sweden.</p>

<p>Tutors and governesses had now left the Castle.
Pastor Harder, a clergyman from Neuwied, came daily
to Princess Elizabeth to lecture upon logic, history, and
Church history. Her intercourse with this esteemed
master was very precious to her, not only on account of
the teaching which she received, but also because she
had the greatest confidence in him. When she felt herself
slighted or misunderstood, she spoke of all that she
otherwise anxiously concealed from every one with Pastor
Harder during their walks. His sermons went to her
heart. In her journals we find many notes and comments
which were written down by the Princess after
these sermons.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1858 the princely pair made a
journey of three months’ duration through Switzerland
and the north of Italy. Prince Otto was well enough
to be of the party. His interest and delight in all the
beauties of nature and art were endless. The sensible
questions of this boy of eight years soon turned the
attention of the guides to him; they addressed their
explanations mostly to the little Prince, who listened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
with glowing interest. He was quite overcome at the
sight of the Falls of the Rhine, and began to recite
“Der Taucher;” he was also enthusiastic for human
greatness, and at Milan was enchanted by the life of
Carlo Borromeo.</p>

<p>Prince Otto was also very witty, and often saw the
comic aspect of things, and he noticed everything, despite
his tender age. He was the pet of all who knew him.
When he felt pretty well joy reigned in the house.
“From his babyhood,” writes the Prince in one of his
letters, “we have seen him growing up, that is, dying a
hundred deaths, which he, being gifted with great vital
power and richly endowed by nature, always overcame
but to begin a new life of pain and distress. If one
thinks of the poor child grown up to man’s estate and
troubled with that dreadful infirmity, which he till then
bore without complaint and accepted gladly as being sent
from God, one’s heart could break from sorrow.” His
mother was not only his unwearying nurse, but his
nearest friend, who shared every thought with him, and
with wonderful power and resignation comforted him
with thoughts of his release.</p>

<p>On the 12th of March 1860 Professor Busch of
Bonn had tried an operation, which had succeeded as far
as circumstances would allow, but only brought renewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
sufferings to the heroic boy. He was bound to his
couch of suffering, but his wonderful gentleness and
amiability and gloriously quiet mind never deserted
him. The body of the boy was lacerated; but the
mind, with its marvellous powers, remained. None of
the sufferings of illness had been able to dull his clear
judgment. His mind, which was even here ennobled
and brought to wonderful perfection, held intercourse
with those about him, as if the poor body did not concern
it.</p>

<p class="title"><i>From a Letter of the Prince of Wied.</i></p>

<p>“A very touching and cordial friendship had existed
between the children ever since their childhood. It was
therefore a great sorrow to them when they had to
separate from their eldest brother in 1879. His parents
had sent Prince William to Basle, where he studied at
the college and lived with Professor Gelzer as a child of
the house, but amidst very different surroundings from
those to which he had been accustomed.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>On the 29th of January Princess Elizabeth writes to
her brother at Basle:&mdash;“My studies are now making great
progress, and I have as many tasks as I can get through.
Forty pages of Schlosser in a week, forty of Macaulay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
twice arithmetic, and twice geometry. More history
and literature instead of Latin and Italian, natural
philosophy and Church history, and, last not least, religion
with mamma. For all these things I have only
two hours daily for preparation, of which one is taken up
with the tasks set me by mamma. I do not learn from
the Catechism usually employed. Mamma has made a
Catechism of her own for me, and in the following
manner:&mdash;During the lesson she has a note-book in her
hand with more than a hundred questions in it. She
puts these questions to me, and we talk them over together;
then she writes one of the questions into my
book, and I write an answer which takes up four to
six pages before the next lesson. I am sure you can
understand what I feel in having entered into the
year in which I have to bind myself with a promise
before the altar to become a responsible member of
human society. I think of it with real apprehension,
for I am not yet ripe for it. Pray think of me sometimes.”</p>

<p>“<i>Monrepos, May 26th, 1860.</i>&mdash;Those were wonderful
days when Professor Gelzer was here. I cannot tell you
how interesting they were. At last I shall become
jealous of you, who have him always about you! What
conversations those were after tea, more interesting than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
all those of the rest of the year put together! I was
always wishing that my head were a wax tablet, that all
he had said might remain engraven upon it.”</p>

<p>In the summer of 1860 Princess Elizabeth was confirmed.
The Princess of Wied had already in the winter
begun to prepare her child for this, and had spoken with
the Prince about all the articles of belief. Forgetting
her own sorrows, the faithful mother had often written
down in the night, beside the bed of suffering of her
beloved son, Prince Otto, the questions and comments
which her daughter was to work out next morning.
When the young girl felt particularly interested in writing
these essays, it often happened that, having begun
in prose, she, almost unwillingly, finished in beautiful
verse. Kirchenrath Dilthey gave her religious instruction
the last two months before her confirmation. This
was done in the open air, whilst walking to and fro with
her in the beautiful avenue of beeches. The sacred
ceremony was performed at Monrepos, and, for the purpose,
the gallery was converted into a chapel. All the
sponsors of the Princess and the nearest relations of the
Houses of Wied and Nassau, as also the Empress of
Germany, then Princess of Prussia, had assembled in
Monrepos for the occasion.</p>

<p>Her poetic journal of that time reveals a soul longing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
for God. In a poem of the 15th July, shortly before
her confirmation therefore, she <span class="locked">writes:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">&mdash;<i>Translated by Sir Edwin Arnold.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In September 1860 she writes in her journal, “Only
the deepest and most absorbing thoughts give us clearness.
Only a purely objective reflection can bring us
knowledge. To delight in undefined feelings and dally
with the images of poetry, draws our soul to the dust
and hinders the stirrings of godly power.”</p>

<p>Now came days and years full of sorrow. Her father
was always ill, her mother occupied in absorbing duties,
the sufferings of her little brother meanwhile increasing.
During the long agony of this beloved son, when the
Princess had to give herself entirely up to nursing him,
Princess Elizabeth passed many hours in her father’s
study. That a man like the Prince of Wied, in whose
mind and mode of thought, mysticism and naturalism,
romantic and rationalistic ideas were united in a peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
manner, should have a great influence over the mental
progress of his daughter, was very natural. Sometimes
she was allowed to work with him, to copy out for him,
to read to him. Then the Prince would ask many
questions of the child, which had been raised through
reading his book “On the Unconscious Life of the Soul.”
He wished to see if she understood what he had written,
and was happy in the impression made on the mind and
heart of his daughter. If she could catch his train of
thought he often said, “So now it is clear! then so
it can remain.”</p>

<p>Still it was but a quiet house for so lively a girl.
“The bird has outgrown its cage,” said the anxious
mother. So it was settled to accept the invitation of
the Queen of Prussia, and to let Princess Elizabeth
travel to Berlin with Fraülein Lavater. We hear from
a letter to her brother what she thought of this plan.</p>

<p>“<i>Neuwied, 24th December 1860.</i>&mdash;Oh! it is hard,
very hard! the first absence from home, the first separation
from mamma. You can realise what it is, and can
understand that it is not easy, and particularly in this
case. The Princess says that she will replace mamma.
But a mother’s love cannot be replaced even by the
warmest and noblest heart! Still I know she will be
all to me that she can be, and that is very much. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
well know what it means to be constantly in the society
of distinguished and clever people. But I also know
what it is to take a position which does not in reality
belong to you, and to assume the right tone and the
right manner there! Oh! shall I be at all able to
do it? You can imagine in what an anxious state
of tension I am, and how all my thoughts are centred
in that one point.”</p>

<p>Such a child of nature as this daughter of a princely
house had never appeared in Berlin before. They were
not a little astonished at her.</p>

<p>“And I had taken the greatest pains to remain within
the bounds of etiquette in the drawing-room, and
to make conversation in a sensible manner.”</p>

<p>She felt most at home in the family of the Princess
Hohenzollern,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> who was spending the winter at Berlin.
When, looking back to this time in later years, as
Princess of Roumania, she wrote: “Had I only had
an idea of all this, when I so enthusiastically admired
the mother at Berlin. Or did I have a presentiment
when I made friends with no one there but with Marie,
and was nowhere so happy as in her family.” She also
then shared in the studies of Princess Marie of Hohenzollern,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
now Countess of Flanders. The lectures which
Professor Haagen held for them in the Museum were
of particularly lively and lasting interest to her.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Mother of the present King of Roumania.</p></div>

<p>It was here in Berlin that Princess Elizabeth met
Prince Charles of Hohenzollern<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> for the first time.
They say that as she was, according to her habit, rapidly
jumping downstairs, she slipped on the last step, and that
Prince Charles was able to prevent her from falling by
catching her in his arms.</p>

</p>

<p>“It appears to me that you have seen and experienced
much that is interesting if you review the
variety of pictures which have passed before you
during these last days. You can only learn an easy
and versatile intercourse with people by constantly
meeting different ones, for each has to be taken in a
different way, according to his peculiarities. Goethe
regards it as a proof of dulness, not cleverness, if one is
bored in the society of others. He declares that we can
learn from the most commonplace people, were it only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
not to be like them! You are a recruit in aristocratic
ranks, and not the slightest failing must be detected in
you. At Court you must learn the balancing step so
that you may not lose your balance and fall downstairs,
or morally stumble and upset. In youth all this is
learnt in play, whereas it is a martyrdom to elderly
people. But where one is gifted, as you are, with an
endless source of internal happiness, all disagreeables
which one experiences are but as a fleeting shadow over
the sunshine of life. Since you went away joy has
departed from this house! The gay little bird has flown,
and is now fluttering from flower to flower. Sometimes
it pricks itself with their thorns, but it flies on, careless
of what is behind it. Still it avoids the thorns in future.
Now, good-bye; may God bless you, you dear little runaway.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Notwithstanding all the kindness and amiability with
which Queen Augusta and the Royal Family surrounded
the charming girl, and the treasures of art of all kinds
that Berlin offered to her, she longed to be back in her
father’s house, in the quiet sick-room, in the freedom of
the Forest and near the mighty Rhine. In her journal
of this time are mainly poems which are full of these
longings. The wild-rose could not feel at home in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
large town, and on her return she fell into the arms of
her mother with sobs of joy.</p>

<p>Prince William had already been for two years at
Basle. During this whole time he had not come to
Neuwied or seen any of his family. Princess Elizabeth
thanks him for the letter she had received in Berlin, and
writes as follows on her return to <span class="locked">Neuwied:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“<i>Neuwied, 29th March 1861.</i>&mdash;Your letter was, in
many respects, a great pleasure to me. It gave me the
feeling that we understand one another and do not lose
the thread of each other’s lives notwithstanding the
separation, which seems to me now very long and hard
to bear. Yet we shall meet again this year. Just
fancy! We shall meet again, and shall both be much
changed, I should think? The same and yet much
altered. I think we have developed and become more
serious. A new life has sprung up in us, and each will
meet the other conscious of his own peculiarities. We
were children till now, and lived together and near one
another without a thought of anything higher. We
parted with heavy hearts, but we had no higher interests
in common. Now we shall meet as a young
man and woman! Serious thoughts have awakened in
us, and we feel that the gay and careless life has ended,
and a life of duty has begun. We have both become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
more serious&mdash;not sad, that is quite another thing&mdash;and
have both had varied experiences this winter. I have
realised that I must become quite different to what I
am, notwithstanding my firm will and true faith, and that
all trouble and care bestowed upon me only led to fresh
difficulties. Those are sad experiences which rob one of
one’s courage, especially if one is a weak girl. And I
did lose courage, particularly when all in the house were
ill again.</p>

<p>“Then came the journey to Berlin, and my stay there!
Certainly these six weeks were not easy, often very difficult.
Yet it was a wonderful time. Rich in all sorts of
experiences. They were all very kind and amiable, every
one helped me in my embarrassment, and understood that I
must be homesick, and yet I felt lonely, dreadfully lonely!
It is really a painful feeling which takes possession of one
when one is away from home. A boy must feel it less,
for he likes to see new places and to try his wings and
see if they are strong. But a girl cannot stand alone.
Often I was very cheerful. I was almost always the
merriest of the girls, but when I had been the gayest,
home-sickness overcame me most, for I then felt
the void to be greater! Still it was very good for
me. I have now realised what duties I have to perform,
and have returned with the resolve to accomplish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
them unflinchingly&mdash;those are my reflections about
Berlin!”</p>

<p>Soon after this, in the year 1861, Professor Busch
came to Neuwied for a consultation. His decision was
most affecting. Not only did the state of the little
Prince seem hopeless, but the health of the Prince of
Wied gave rise to the greatest anxiety. Neither could
recover; it was only a question of time.</p>

<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">Monrepos</span>, <i>13th June 1861</i>.
</p>

<p>“It is not at all easy to keep physically and mentally
fresh and bright, and yet it is my duty! It is my duty
towards myself that I may not flag, and it is a duty
towards our invalids to try and enliven them; it is also
my duty towards mamma that everything may not weigh
upon her. I have much that refreshes me now. My
white pony, which I love and which loves me, and which
I ride every day. I always say that it suits me particularly,
for when it is fresh it kicks and often jumps with
its four legs off the ground at once. It is a mad little
thing! It has many names, ‘Schimmel, Selim, Minsmuns,
Herr Consistorialrath, Garibaldi’&mdash;this reminds me
of a real Garibaldi in Italy. I am sure you are glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Italy is free. But the death of Cavour is dreadful. It
came upon us like a thunderclap. One cannot understand
how the machine is to remain in motion without
him, as no one appears so considerate, so clever, or so
powerful as he. I think that even his enemies must
admit what a wonderful man he was!</p>

<p>We live in a remarkable time, which must interest us.
And yet it interests me more when Pastor Harder tells
me of past history than as now of the years 1815&ndash;1820.
My studies are a great refreshment to me.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In June the family moved up to Monrepos. Prince
Otto’s sufferings increased from month to month. For
nearly a year he bore the acutest pain, fully realising that
he must die soon. His mother had tried to make his
approaching death easy by telling of the Redeemer and
heavenly happiness. With all the powers of his loving
nature and noble mind, this boy constantly endeavoured
to prevent others suffering from his illness. “Till his
last day he was unceasingly trying to improve his heart
and mind.”</p>

<p>On the 17th of October 1861 Princess Elizabeth
writes to Prince William at Basle:&mdash;“You should soon
write to Ottoli, and send him your photograph if possible.
What comes from you has ever a peculiar charm for him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
All that you do and say is right in his eyes. We often
say something against you in fun, just to see the eagerness
with which he defends you. You are his ideal.
We are for ever talking of you. We can never tire of
this subject, for only now that you are absent we have
discovered how we love you. Otto’s love to us is deeper
and stronger than ever, such as I have never experienced
in any one in good health. There is a marvellous charm
in those great serious eyes which appear to triumph over
the miseries of the body. I know that you have lived
through all this time with us, and share the heavy burden
as well as the rich blessing. It is a wonderful experience!
All seems so trivial now. All that people say
and do seems so small and of so little importance when
God Himself speaks to us.”</p>

<p>“<i>Monrepos, 7th November 1861.</i>&mdash;This time of trial
binds us closer to one another. It is remarkable that I
love every one more than I did before. I love God more,
and this makes my love to other people deeper. My
heart seems so enlarged that it longs to enfold the whole
world. You see that I must now keep all these feelings
to myself in order to be outwardly calm, and, should
all this boil within me, quietly and steadily fulfil all
my duties.”</p>

<p>On the 18th of October 1861 we find a little poem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
written in the Princess’s journal, “The Sick-room” is its

</div>

<p><i>“Monrepos, 14th December 1861.</i>&mdash;God is now leading
me by a way which I had not expected. The whole
year, now soon to end, has been a sad one!</p>

<p>“But this Christmas is to be particularly celebrated,
as it is the last which we shall have together! You
cannot fancy how anxious papa makes us now. He
is very weak and coughs almost incessantly. Pastor
Harder remarked lately how good and gentle he was,
as if he were for ever taking leave of us. The idea
is so dreadful that I am always trying to get rid of it.
I long to hold him in every glance and each embrace,
for I love him as never before!</p>

<p>“I am with him from nine till one of a morning now.
He gives me lessons in painting, which are an indescribable
pleasure to me. My playing is also a great resource
to him. Do you realise what a pleasure this is, though
a melancholy pleasure! You really must feel and experience
it with me. So my life now belongs entirely
to my father. I am always about him, or occupied with
him, reading, painting, playing, or walking up and down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
All trivialities disappear before the imposing thought of
having to minister to two dying people with the self-sacrificing
power of love.”</p>

<p>“<i>31st of December.</i>&mdash;We do not know how early
or how late papa and Otto may be taken from us, but
we will be prepared that we may be able to sustain
mamma with the strength of our youth, that she may
really lean upon us, and that, after her dreadful trials,
we may smooth and enlarge the way before her, that
she may rest at last! Let us now wrestle and strive
and pray with all our might, that we may give back to
her all she did for us. I long to help mamma to bear
the heavy burden, and I should love to give myself up
to her entirely with all that I am and all that I have,
and yet I cannot do it! I cannot measure her sorrow,
but I hope that what I can and should do will be put
into my heart, and then we will all be thankful for this
time of trial! You can do this at a distance as well as
here. Distance makes no difference, and God will show
it you. You must ripen to manhood early, and be firm,
energetic, and true. Then you will be very much to me,
and the dream of my childhood that we should be all in
all to one another will be fulfilled!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
In January 1862 the Prince of Wied became so
dangerously ill that he could not leave his bed. Princess
Elizabeth nursed her father, whose sufferings were added
to by increasing deafness. The mother sat day and
night by the couch of her courageous son, who was so
strong in faith, and saw her child slowly dying, under
the most dreadful sufferings. Prince Otto had an ardent
wish to see his beloved brother William once more.
A telegram was sent to Basle. But the answer was
that the Prince had the measles and could not travel.
At first the Princess did not dare to communicate this
answer to Prince Otto. But in the night he asked
again after his brother, and had to learn the truth. He
cried out: “My William! My William, is he to be
taken from me too?” After that he was quiet and said,
“If it is not to be, it is well.” And then he kept
repeating, “Send him my blessing.”</p>

<p>On the 16th February 1862 Prince Otto was released
from his life of suffering. “More than we can bear is
not sent to us” he had often said, “and when we can
bear no longer, the end comes and we are blessed in
Heaven.” He died in full consciousness. An expression
of rest and peace came over the beautiful countenance.
The mouth had a sweet smile. Only the deep
mark on the high forehead showed that he had obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
this peace through great suffering and strife. “Thank
God, and God be praised for ever” were the words
uttered by the agonised mother over the little body.
“And God be praised” was the prayer repeated after
her by the father, the brother and sister and friends and
relations far and near. By all indeed who had loved
and admired the gifted child. Kirchenrath Dilthey,
from Neuwied, who had confirmed and married the
Princess of Wied, and had confirmed Princess Elizabeth,
undertook the ceremony of blessing the body, and
preached from the following words in the Book of
Wisdom iv. 13, 14: “He being made perfect in a short
time, fulfilled a long time: for his soul pleased the Lord,
therefore hasted He to take him away from among the
wicked.”</p>

<p class="title"><i>Extract from a letter from the Prince of Wied.</i></p>

<p>“According to his wish, Prince Otto was buried on a
hill not far from Monrepos, under the shade of high lime
trees. His memory will be glorified in our recollections,
and this holy memory, this communion with the dead, is
all that remains to us. An incorruptible legacy, which
makes us rich, notwithstanding our endless loss.”</p>

not till fourteen years afterwards that Princess Elizabeth
could try to write down the sad experience of this time.

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> Palace at Neuwied now became lonely
and dreary. Immediately after the funeral
of Prince Otto, the princely pair had left
for Baden-Baden with Princess Elizabeth.
They did not return till the summer, and, as usual, went
to live on the heights of Monrepos. The landscape lay
stretched out before them in the full glory of summer;
the birds chirped and sang in the beech-woods; on the
hills, under the lime-trees, everything was awakened to
new life, and pointed to a future where sorrows and
partings are no more. Many months passed before a
monument could be placed over the grave. But Princess
Elizabeth took care that it was not without its
adornment. Every morning before six she mounted the
hill, and with the flowers which were sent from Neuwied
to Monrepos every evening, she transformed the resting-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>place
of her brother into a carpet of flowers. Often she
knelt for hours under the dome formed by the limes in
order to arrange the leaves and flowers very artistically.
The silence about her was only disturbed by the hum
of the bees and the solemn sound of the church bells,
which reached her on the height from the valley below.
For eleven years Prince Otto had been the centre of all
love and care. After this season of sorrow and suffering
it was necessary again to recover strength to begin
life afresh by means of active work.</p>

<p>With all the powers of her eager nature Princess
Elizabeth now threw herself into teaching. At that
time a Baroness Bibra was living at a farm near, with
her two little nieces. A lame boy, Rudolf Wackernagel,
had been taken in at the Castle on account of his weak
health. With these three children the young Princess
had arranged a school. She displayed so much patience,
perseverance, and talent for imparting knowledge, that
her mother watched her work with quiet contentment.
She brought the little Wackernagel on so well that he
took a good place in the College at Basle. Her time
was fully occupied. She gave lessons for three hours;
for three hours she was allowed to read to her father
and rejoice in his presence; for four or five hours she
practised on the piano. This irresistible craving for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
occupation, which was to set free her inner feelings and
lighten her sorrow for her brother, seemed too great a
mental strain for so young a creature. But Princess
Elizabeth bore up against it with great cheerfulness, and
writes to her <span class="locked">brother:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“<i>Monrepos, 29th January 1862.</i>&mdash;I am so happy because
the child loves me and likes to be with me. A
short time ago I said that I had a vocation for teaching,
and would willingly become a governess, and now this
duty thrusts itself suddenly and unexpectedly upon me,
with the anxious question, ‘Are you capable of teaching
and training a child? Are you sufficiently in sympathy
with him to understand his nature, and yet to treat
him consistently?’ I regard this new duty in a very
serious light, and take great pains with the lessons,
which are a great pleasure to me, for the little boy
is so very lively and intelligent.”</p>

<p>“<i>Monrepos, 10th August 1862.</i>&mdash;Generally ‘Rudi’
is very eager to learn, and when he is not I make a
cross face; then he gets red and his thoughts are concentrated
again. It is naturally my greatest wish to
fulfil this arduous and yet to me so dear a duty in such
a manner that I may build a good and firm foundation
for coming years, for I know only too well how much
harm can be done if the elements are badly taught.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Oh! condition of a governess. You never found such
a representative before. Respect comes of itself, learning
goes like bread and butter, and the whole world is
a bagpipe. Who can plague themselves for ever? It is
good to be merry sometimes. All goes successfully;
love is there too, and so one lives in Elysium. Joy,
lovely spark of the gods&mdash;but here I remember the
musical <i>fête</i> at Cologne. How heavenly it was! You
cannot have the least idea of it! To hear the Ninth
Symphony of Beethoven with a chorus at the <span class="locked">end&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="in0">Words cannot convey it, and I cannot describe it to
you. Child of man, it was divine! When I think of it
I seem to be lost in endless space, for melodies and
harmonies rush upon me, which can make the most unfeeling
tremble and raise the soul to God. I should
like to fall on my knees and give thanks that some of
us human beings have been chosen to divine God. Yes,
we may often appear wretched and miserable, and might
almost be ashamed to belong to that worm, mankind;
still, there are moments in this life when we may feel
ourselves great and blissfully exclaim, ‘Heavenly Father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>

<p>The state of health of the Prince of Wied necessitated
another sojourn in Baden-Baden. There the winter of
1862&ndash;1863 was passed. In order to introduce Princess
Elizabeth to society their house was opened to a larger
circle.</p>

<p>Princess Elizabeth’s first ball was at the Court of
Carlsruhe, but she found no real pleasure in such amusements.
Her beloved friend, Marie von Bibra, lay on her
deathbed. “My heart seemed torn! My brother had
died within the year; my friend was struggling with
death. And then people were surprised at my being
serious and philosophising.” At that time she drove
twice a week to the Grand Duchess of Baden at Carlsruhe,
to take lessons on the piano from Kalliwoda, and
she learned flower-painting from Frau Schoedter. During
this time in Baden-Baden there must have been a

<p>On the 20th of February 1863 Marie von Bibra had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
died, “quietly and gently as she had lived.” Elizabeth

<p>“It certainly is a good thing that we first learnt to
know the serious side of life, for now we do not long for
or expect anything of it, but only think of that which we
have to do. I, for my part, expect much sorrow and
many tears; they came to me early, and it probably will
continue to be so. One loved one after the other is
taken away. Each year demands its sacrifice! At how
many graves shall I have to stand till I am old? I do
not think that I shall die early. I feel much power in
me and an intense longing for work. I only wish to fill
my little place, to accomplish my humble duties, so that,
when I die, I may not feel that I have lived in vain.
The feeling of having work to do is so pleasant to me;
I do not think I could be happy without it. To have
stern duties which occupy one from morning till night
is the greatest happiness.</p>

<p>“At my Confirmation I felt so strong that no struggle
seemed too hard. I thought I could do everything.
Since then I have done nothing, and have only had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
suffer, which I did not at all expect. I have become
much quieter now. I can sit still and think of the dear
departed ones, whilst I never could rest for a moment
before. Happily I have not much time for thinking.
When I have taught for three hours and practised four
hours, I have to entertain papa and mamma in the
evening. We read after tea. Lately we read ‘Fiesco.’
Now I am reading ‘Tasso’ aloud, but I do not think
it so beautiful as ‘Iphigenia.’ The language is beautiful&mdash;quite

and I are talking about it all day. I am quite confused
with joy! Only three more days and then we shall be
together and all in all to each other. Oh! with my
whole heart and with the deepest love I will hang about
you, my pride, my joy, the support on which I will
lean, when you are morally strong and firm. Only
realise how I love you, so passionately, and yet my love
is so deep and still in the holiest corner of my heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>

<p>When they returned to Monrepos in the spring,
Marie’s gentle words could no longer quiet the restless
spirit, and the want of this faithful friend lay heavy on
the life and soul of the young Princess. The arrival
of the Grand Duchess Hélène of Russia, who came to
Monrepos on a visit this summer, seemed to her like
a ray of sunshine. She was a near relation of the
Princess of Wied, and sister of the Duchess Pauline of
Nassau, the much-honoured stepmother of the Princess.
The Grand Duchess was much attracted by the simple
and natural manner of the Princess Elizabeth; she was
also pleased with her thorough learning and her original
thoughts. It was a wish of the Grand Duchess to take
the charming girl with her on her travels, to which her
parents did not object. Elizabeth rejoiced at the news,
for a great love and admiration for her distinguished
aunt had taken her heart by storm, and she was more
than happy to see the world under the auspices of this
remarkable woman.</p>

<p>So she travelled with the Grand Duchess Hélène to
the Lake of Geneva in the autumn of 1863, where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
lived in Ouchy, at the Hôtel Beaurivage. These were
happy weeks; it was the first <i>dolce far niente</i> which
the Princess had known, the first time that she was
among utter strangers. Wherever the Grand Duchess
settled, she was soon surrounded by a circle of interesting
people. Our young Princess was quite carried away
by this talented society, the magnificence of nature
around her, and the excursions on the blue lake and in
the surrounding valleys. Intense in her joys as in her
sorrows, she felt herself, as she then said, “like a bird
freed from its cage.”</p>

<p>On the 21st of October 1863 she writes to her
mother from Beaurivage:&mdash;“I never thought that one
could enjoy such a long time without a cloud to hide
the sunshine for one day. I wish I could return with
my pockets full of sunshine and warm you up. I am
daily thrown with distinguished people&mdash;as if I did not
have that at home too!&mdash;but their talent shows itself
in a different manner, and I pay more attention to it.
There is no stiffness in our society, but it is always
aristocratic. The witty sayings of cultivated people are
so pleasant to hear. I love my aunt more every day;
I am happy to be near her, and when she is in the
room I only think of her! And, do you know, I like
to be grateful; it is a warm feeling.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
Princess Elizabeth had always exercised an irresistible
fascination on all that came near her by the grace and
charm of her mind. But her young niece became so
beloved and so necessary to the Grand Duchess that she
entreated her parents to allow her to accompany her to
St. Petersburg for the winter. The Princess of Wied
answered, “All the sacrifices which it costs her parents
to be separated from so beloved a daughter must disappear
before the advantages which such a time would
offer our child.” A short stay was made at Wiesbaden
on the way to St. Petersburg in order to take leave of
her parents. Princess Elizabeth was not to see her
father again! It was a separation for life! As the
Prince was gazing after her, when she was gone, he
remarked to his wife, “There she goes, in her simplicity,
and I am quite sure she will return to us as simple
as she leaves us.” These words were to be entirely
realised. Professor Knauss sketched a portrait of her
at Berlin; then they went north without stopping.</p>

<p>St. Petersburg as a town did not make a great impression
on her. “The similarity and uniformity of the
masses of houses destroy the proportions,” she writes to
her mother. The agreeable young Princess was cordially
welcomed by the Emperor Alexander II. and the whole
Imperial family: “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Tout le monde est sous son charme</i>,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
the Grand Duchess Alexandra Josephanna wrote to the
Princess of Wied. She had found her nearest relations
in the family of Prince Peter of Oldenburg, for his wife,
Princess Thérèse, who was a Princess of Nassau, was her
mother’s sister. She met the young Princesses of Oldenburg
and Leuchtenberg almost daily. Yet with all
this, an extraordinary shyness had taken hold of Princess
Elizabeth. An expression of painful embarrassment
overspread her expressive features. The unconstrained
manner which had so delighted every one at Ouchy had
disappeared. She felt strange in her new and brilliant
surroundings. The grandeur of life at St. Petersburg,
with its ceaseless dinners, balls, and other entertainments,
tired and seemed to dazzle her. Her imagination was
much excited by all these new impressions, but her nerves
suffered under them. To calm this restless spirit, the
Grand Duchess had arranged a regular plan for the
day, and had instituted Shakespeare evenings with the
Princesses of Oldenburg and Leuchtenberg, at which the
parts were divided and read in the original English.</p>

<p>At that time the Grand Duchess Hélène wrote to the
Princess of Wied:&mdash;“Elizabeth makes a sympathetic
impression on all at St. Petersburg. Her open and
cheerful glance refreshes those that are worn and weary,
and youth becomes more joyous in her company. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
day is filled up with music, reading, the study of
Russian, and the time she spends with me. I have also
entreated her always to have a good book in reading.
To heighten her interest and get her to work herself, I
advised her to write out parts and make comments upon
it for you. Be it here or in another centre of the great
world, we must remember that we deteriorate, if we do
not try to get away from the frivolity that surrounds us
by serious thinking and reading.”</p>

<p>Let us hear Princess Elizabeth describe her life in the
Northern capital in her own <span class="locked">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="title"><i>To her Brother.</i></p>

<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">St. Petersburg</span>, <i>2nd December 1863</i>.
</p>

<p>“After one has seen London and Paris, St. Petersburg
does not make a great impression upon one. Palaces
never impress me, and we also have carpets and silk
furniture. Still, there are great dimensions in everything
here, and that is agreeable. The only palace which I
think pleasant to live in is the one I inhabit. I spend
almost all my time in two dear rooms. Either in the
library, where I read Ranke’s English History and the
<i>South German Newspaper</i> till eleven o’clock every morning,
or I am in my bedroom, which is hardly larger than
our rooms in Monrepos. As I have a dressing-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
next door, this is really my little sanctum and boudoir,
in which I keep all my pictures and keepsakes. Next
to this room is another, in which there is one of Erard’s
grand pianos and a harmonium. There I practise for
two hours every day. On Mondays and Thursdays I am
in the Museum from one to three, and have drawing-lessons
from models. On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and
Saturdays, from half-past twelve to half-past one, I learn
Russian. On Sundays (but that will be altered) I have
a music-lesson from&mdash;you will see I am a most fortunate
being&mdash;from Rubinstein! Dinner is at six. The
evenings vary much. On Mondays is the Opera. On
Tuesdays, Eugenia von Leuchtenberg (a cousin of Uncle
Oscar’s), Thecla (Princess of Oldenburg), and some other
girls and I meet, and we read Shakespeare (a family
Shakespeare naturally), each taking a character. Yesterday
we read ‘King Lear.’ That is magnificent! To-day
I went to a school to hear a most interesting lecture on
Chateaubriand. I spend many evenings with my aunt,
and often I have one lady or another to tea with me.
Sometimes there is a concert on a Thursday. Oh! it
really is wonderful how these people play! Lately I
heard a piece from ‘Orpheus’ by Glück, and the Symphony
in A Minor by Mendelssohn. I was in such raptures
that I did not seem to belong to this world. Interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
people often come to dinner, but never more than
three or four. You can fancy how pleasant it is. The
other day the old natural historian, Baer, came&mdash;a very
distinguished and amiable German. My heart seemed to
beat loud when he spoke of Holstein and Prussia. I
get quite excited when I think of it, for, you must know,
I silently glow for Schleswig-Holstein here. My aunt is
very good to me, and I am daily becoming more attached
to Fräulein Rahden. She is quite a mother to me, and
that is what I long for more and more, and often so
deeply. Still, I am really happy here. I rest myself,
and am really very well. I usually go to bed at midnight
and get up at cock-crow, but that only takes place
after eight o’clock.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>At the beginning of this time, Anton Rubinstein had
undertaken her musical education. When the Princess
was expecting him, a great excitement took possession
of her, which almost took away her breath. She looked
up to her master with such veneration that she lost all
courage in the consciousness of her own small talent.
She says about Rubinstein’s playing:&mdash;“It was as if the
piano disappeared under his power; then again as if it
were the music of the spheres, or a lovely fairy tale.
His playing has a delicacy and a poetry which are really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
fascinating. His genius is displayed in the fact that the
power and brilliancy of his playing seem but accessories,
or are so grand that one is cowed before them as by a
wonder of nature, and yet would like to sing in the intensity
of joy. I never heard anything like it. His
playing has a magic spell which seems to me like the
bloom on a grape or the dew on the flowers. They
render them twice as beautiful.”</p>

<p>Of all the enjoyments which were offered to her in St.
Petersburg, the most deep and lasting impression was
made upon her by the performance of the Court singers.
She was quite overcome by the artistic rendering, and
the wonderful harmony of their songs, in the celebrated
concerts led by Livow, as well as during the service in
the chapel of the Winter Palace.</p>

<p>Christmas-time brought unexpected happiness. Prince
Nicholas of Nassau had arrived. He also lived in the
Palais Michel as the guest of his aunt, the Grand
Duchess Hélène. Part of her German home seemed to
have arrived in St. Petersburg with the appearance of
this beloved uncle, and in the daily intercourse with
him, for he had often spent months in the house of her
parents from her childhood upward.</p>

</div>

<p>She was proud of her German home on the German
river. Because of these patriotic feelings she was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
called “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la petite Allemagne</i>” in Ouchy by the octogenarian
Count Kisseleff. In St. Petersburg also she
openly and freely confessed her love for her Fatherland.
Many a playful battle did she engage in with the
young Grand Dukes. “For, you know,” she wrote to
her mother, “my heart only glows for Germany!”</p>

<p>On the 25th of December 1863 she writes to her
parents:&mdash;“When I thank you for the signs of your
love, I really go much deeper and thank you for something
else: something so high, so true, and so holy, that
I cannot whisper it even, though it makes me so unboundedly
happy. This beautiful feeling is that we
love one another so much, so very much, that one can
breathe peace to the other through his peace, joy through
his joy.... It is the blessing of my life that God
sends me so much love. My sympathies are ever widening,
and my heart does not seem able to contain the
fulness of the sunbeams! I can never requite you, but
may perhaps impart my feelings to others, if God wills!”</p>

<p>The unwholesome climate of St. Petersburg and the
over-straining of her nerves soon showed themselves to
have a detrimental effect on the health of the till then
so blooming Princess. She could take but little part
in the festivities of Christmas-time, and on the 1st of
January 1864 she became alarmingly ill of a nervous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
gastric fever. The Grand Duchess surrounded her with
motherly love and care. The Grand Duchess Catherine
and the lady-in-waiting, Baroness Edith von Rahden,
nursed and watched her unceasingly. But weeks went
by, and she still lay in bed. It was the first illness she
had ever had. Till now, when she had reached her
twentieth year, she had never tasted any medicine. As
soon as she was released from pain and could occupy
herself, she became absorbed in the book of “The Unconscious
Life of the Soul,” which her father had sent
her as a Christmas present. She writes from her bed:&mdash;“There
is such great humility in the preface, combined
with the power of assurance. Then I recognised
my father in the first three pages by his manner of
demonstrating his arguments. What a different sort of
reading it is when the language is as familiar to us as
our own, when we see the idea before us which we have
absorbed as the very breath of our life! I am glad that
papa has sent me the book just now. As I read, I see
his face before me, and seem to be really talking to him.”</p>

<p>On the 16th of January 1864 she wrote to her
father:&mdash;“How often a feeling of pride comes over me
that I have my father’s writings in my hands, and then
a glow of happiness, because every word has come from
your pen and from your inmost heart! For your soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
was prepared by the wonderful experiences of fifty years,
and the mind could communicate to her unhindered, and
tell her what it will about itself and its nature. It is
such a beautiful idea, that the indwelling Spirit of God
educates the soul and gives to it as much as it requires.
Not a word more. It makes one very humble, and
awakes in one a longing to keep the soul so pure (by
withstanding its natural earthly temptations), that God
may find it worthy of having many things revealed to it!
But how is it with the mind and the soul of Christ?
That is the mystery of His godly and yet human nature;
His soul must have been so pure, so much above earthly
things, that God could tell it all things.</p>

<p>“I am getting on well now, and enjoy these quiet
days in which I can collect my thoughts. I think they
will keep me out of the stream of society, for they see
that it tires me. There will be between forty and fifty
balls before the Carnival, when they will rush about for
a week&mdash;the so-called ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">folles journées</i>.’ But do not be
anxious. That is not in my line. It is very odd, but
I read ninety pages of philosophy yesterday, and felt so
rested, that all were surprised to see me look so well.
But if only two or three ladies begin to gossip about
all the noise and bustle going on, I fall to pieces like
a withered leaf. To my joy, I notice what a strong constitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
I have, for real thinking refreshes me, while
excitement of the nerves makes me ill. Yes, my beloved
ones, I feel every day how wonderfully you have
educated me, and what you have given me for life&mdash;a
great treasure, the hoard of the Nibelungen, which also
lies in the Rhine; but I know the spot, and draw from
it every day.</p>

<p class="sigright b1">

</p>

<p>On the 18th of January 1864 she writes:&mdash;“I am
becoming so philosophical now, so quiet and sensible,
that it is a real pleasure. If only it remains thus! I
really do not know why I should be so anxious, that
I see the dark side of everything, and am convinced
that everything must go wrong. And all goes right&mdash;and
without my troubling.”</p>

<p>On the 20th of January:&mdash;“You cannot think what
a sense of repose has come over me, and a power of
work and concentration at the same time, which I have
not had since last year. I can control my thoughts
much better and keep them on the same track. But
the book is too beautiful, and I absorb it. It has come
to my quiet room and my peaceful heart at the right
time. Here it can influence me strongly, and no one
hinders it.”</p>

<p>On the 25th of January, for her mother’s <span class="locked">birthday:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
“We are all there, you dear mother, with our love and
our childish longings, and have our arms tightly round
you, so that you may lead us, and we guide you. For
in our weakness and dependence in you lies our strength.
The feeling that we love you makes you strong. You
must be strong, that we may not fall. Oh! my beloved
mother, what strength is there in love! It overcomes
time and space. In love lies the idea of eternity, and
love alone can understand eternity, which we cannot
grasp. I feel that we seem to become more and more
intimate, and that is very natural. How anxiously I
used to bar all the doors of my heart! Now I open them
all wide, very wide, and, of course, you are at home
everywhere! I feel more strongly than ever that if ever
anything should separate me from you I should become
as dry and colourless as a withered leaf in winter.”</p>

<p>Princess Elizabeth now felt stronger, and began her
life with the Grand Duchess again. She was, however,
suddenly seized by a relapse of the illness she had just
had. It was a sad and anxious time for the Princess
of Wied, and these days of trial were almost more than
she could bear, for the Prince of Wied lay on his deathbed,
and his strength was slowly ebbing away. She
writes:&mdash;“My child is ill at a great distance from me,
and, for the first time, I am not there to nurse her. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
know she is in God’s care, and nursed by loving and
faithful people. But that does not take the load of
anxiety off my heart.”</p>

<p>When the mild spring weather came, on the 1st of
March the young Princess was allowed to go out in the
fresh air.</p>

<p class="title"><i>To her Brother.</i></p>

<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">St. Petersburg</span>, <i>2nd March 1864</i>.
</p>

<p>“I have been wonderfully dissipated this winter! I
was at a little ball the Emperor gave before Christmas,
and at a small dancing-party here at the end of January.
Next week is the Carnival, at which my presence will be
doubtful, and then everything, even the theatre, comes
to an end. Is it not really quite wonderful that I have
not become frivolous in all this whirl of society! And
now I have been seventeen days in bed, ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pour combler
les plaisirs</i>;’ it really is an anxious matter.</p>

<p>“But now I must leave off this jesting tone and
tell you that I really like to be here, surrounded by
the most touching affection and in the society of many
amiable and talented people. And then the music that
I can hear here!&mdash;this is the only thing for which I am
for ever craving. I do not care for the balls, and my
good time comes in Lent; then comes one concert after
another&mdash;all splendid music. To crown it all, Frau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Schumann arrived yesterday. I have seen her already.
She was in Düsseldorf and Baden, and can tell me of
all my dear friends. If Heaven but grants me a little
health, I can now pick up again what I have missed, and
blissfully breathe in music.</p>

<p>“This illness often seemed unbearable to me, because
I never seemed to get better. It was so difficult to be
patient,&mdash;and then the home-sickness! When I am well
I can overcome it, but in illness I long for mamma as a
little child. It was rather a difficult ordeal, but it must
have been good for me, if only to teach me anew to be
still. God wished to see whether I had not forgotten
this lesson. Alas! I had done so, and that made it so
hard to bear.”</p>

<p>It seemed as if Princess Elizabeth would now soon get
strong. But the news of her father’s death reached her
in a few days. The Prince of Wied had passed a winter
of acute suffering at Baden. When free from pain he
had dictated an essay “On the Mystery of Human Individualities.”
He had written to his daughter for the
last time shortly before his death, and answered some
questions she had made about his book, “The Unconscious
Life of the Soul.” His strength was waning
slowly, and on the 5th of March 1864 he had ceased to
suffer. The mortal remains were brought up to Monrepos,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
a large procession following, and lie under the
lime-trees, beside those of his son, who died so early.
The Princess of Wied wrote his epitaph in the following
<span class="locked">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Made perfect through Suffering, and patient in Hope,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What he humbly sought in Life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, being set free, has now found in the Light.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Princess Elizabeth had been passionately attached to
her father, and owed much of her intellectual progress to
him. Her sorrow at his loss was increased because she
had not been able to be near him during his last days.
Still, no complaint passed her lips. She bore her sorrow
with great resignation and self-control, which made a
deep and touching impression on all about her. She
wished to be strong in order to support and comfort her
mother, and this thought supported her&mdash;“We will fill
the desolate rooms with our love, and find our happiness
in each other.” She wrote to her: “As a tree that has
been felled leaves a light space in the forest, so a light
remains after the death of a great man!” And so her
father, whom she had loved and admired with all her heart,
appeared to her as a bright example. She tried to think
and to act as he would have wished. She formed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
opinions in the large-hearted manner that her father
had done, and with his able and generous disposition
towards all; never, therefore, immediately condemning
the opinions of others, but first sifting them thoroughly.

<p>Soon after this, on the 20th of April, the Princess
Louise of Wied died. She had reached the age of
ninety-two years, and was much loved and mourned at
Neuwied, on account of her charity to the poor.</p>

<p>The presence of her uncle, Prince Nicholas of Nassau,
was a great comfort to Princess Elizabeth in her sorrow;
but he had to return home, and she could not go with
him, though she had a great longing to be with her
mother. The Grand Duchess Hélène intended to travel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
to Germany in the spring, and wished to bring back the
young girl to her mother herself. So she had to wait
patiently without murmuring.</p>

<p>Clara Schumann came to St. Petersburg early in
March, and lived in the Michailow Palace. As Rubinstein
could not continue her musical instruction, Princess
Elizabeth took lessons of Clara Schumann, and writes:&mdash;“And
I gazed meanwhile into the beautiful and sad
eyes, and thought of all that this woman had suffered,
and of the courage with which she had battled her way
through life.... It must be very consoling to be old,
for then a great feeling of repose comes over us, for
which I often long. Every day, I strive for internal
peace, which is so soothing, but I must obtain it by
many storms and much strife.... Even my aunt said
the other day, ‘One can see that you were not made
for life in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grand monde</i>.’ I am only myself in solitude;
the bustle of the world makes me feel frightened
and shy. You, my beloved mother, are the only being
that has as much patience with me as God Himself,
who is not surprised at anything I do or say, to whom
I can tell everything, and who always understands me.
And I think you can feel what great happiness still is
mine, as I have such a mother!”</p>

<p>As Princess Elizabeth did not now join the large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
parties on account of her mourning, the highest intellectual
interests became the favourite topics of the
circle round the Grand Duchess Hélène. The famous
member of the Academy, Baer, Count Keyserlingk,
Privy Councillor Brevern, Henselt the musician, and
many other of the learned and distinguished men were
in and out of the Palais Michel, to the great joy of
the young girl, who was so thirsty for knowledge.</p>

<p>The Grand Duchess Hélène had announced herself
at Moscow for Easter. Her niece was allowed to accompany
her, and saw Eastern magnificence and architecture
for the first time there. On the 4th of May 1864 she
writes from Moscow:&mdash;“We are in Moscow, that old
patriotic town, with its houses of one or two stories,
green roofs, and four hundred churches, which are all
aglow with the brightest colours. The dimensions of
the streets are so enormous that one does not know
where the street ends and the open space begins. It
is too curious! The town, with its one-storied houses
and their surrounding gardens, is quite countrified,
almost like a village, and yet it is beautiful. You
only see little houses, which are very gay, and still
gayer churches. These are bright blue, with light green
roofs or domes, or red, green, and blue, all brightly
mixed. I think Moscow is only beautiful in bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
sunshine, when the hundreds of domes are glistening
and throwing their rays on the green roofs. In the
Kremlin I saw the treasures of the Church, as also
the treasury and armoury in which all the crowns are
kept. I am most interested by the antiquity of these
things and their historical recollections. There is also
kept the enormous silver caldron in which the holy oil
is prepared and consecrated. Every three years it is
made to simmer for three days and mixed with sweet-scented
herbs, whilst prayers are unceasingly offered;
then it is consecrated and blessed in the church, and
is now called <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">le saint crême</i>. Forty to fifty pots are
then filled with it. This oil is much prized far and
near, as it is used for the consecration of churches, as
well as at births and deaths. The many and different
ways in which people try to make themselves holy
touch me much; and even if we are inclined to ask
what is the use of this oil and holy water, we must
admit that it displays a childish craving to be purified,
and a firm faith in the power of prayer, which
can consecrate everything. I find so much cheerfulness
and childish faith in the rites of the Greek Church, and
less superstition than in the Roman Catholic, but none
of the earnestness of ours. It strikes me, too, that
our Church in her noblest form&mdash;as I speak of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
others in their noblest form&mdash;is eminently suited to
the German character. We have all a tendency to
be absorbed in thought, to muse on our own nature,
and to seek to attain to a knowledge of God through
our own inmost hearts.”</p>

<p>After her return from a most interesting excursion to
the monastery of St. Sergius, Princess Elizabeth says in
a letter to her mother:&mdash;“The monastery is wide, low,
and massive, like all Byzantine churches, and partly
gloomy, or too bright for our taste. Everything in the
Byzantine churches is bright and cheerful, and the
religion is also a cheerful one. It is the religion of the
Resurrection. Good Friday is hardly kept at all, whereas
Easter is kept for a week. They are naturally cheerful,
and even the monks look bright and uncultivated. They
differ entirely from the hollow-cheeked ascetic monks of
the West, nor have their monasteries the same influence
as our monasteries.”</p>

<p>Princess Elizabeth was quite delighted with the expedition
to Moscow. She was charmed with the palace
of the Grand Duchess, with the large garden adjoining,
and the daily life was more like that of a family party.
Everything reminded her of Monrepos. She felt herself
unrestrained, at home; her health was restored, and she
fully enjoyed every pleasure. Attended by the ladies-in-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>waiting,
she was sent by the Grand Duchess to visit the
many charitable institutions, and behaved with so much
assurance that it appeared as if she were in the habit of
inspecting and examining. On getting into the train
on her return journey she exclaimed, “Those were happy
days,” as she gazed back at the old city of the Czars.</p>

<p>The time of her stay at St. Petersburg was coming to
an end. For her future life it was to be a time of great
importance. She had become accustomed to life at a
great Court, had learnt to know the rites and ceremonies
of the Greek Church, and her social and intellectual
sphere had widened during her stay with the Grand
Duchess Hélène. In a letter which she wrote as reigning
Princess of Roumania six years later she dwells upon
this as follows:&mdash;“I feel every day what a blessing my
intercourse with my aunt and her circle of friends was
for my whole life. In my present position it is of untold
value to me.”</p>

<p>Early in June the Grand Duchess brought her niece
back to Germany. The Princess of Wied awaited her
daughter at Leipsic. What a sorrowful meeting it was!
And the return to the desolate Monrepos was hardly to
be borne. Her deep sorrow for the loss of her father,
which she had had to keep back, now broke out with
all its power. Wherever she looked she seemed to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
him, and she thought she could not live without him.
She longed for his words of teaching, which had brought
her to think for herself; for the old habits, which always
had him for their object and centre.</p>

<p>Since the death of her husband, the Princess of Wied
had spent summer and winter at Monrepos. Here she
had arranged a very cosy room for her daughter, who
soon loved it on account of its quiet and retirement.
Photographs and engravings from great masters and
portraits of those dearest to her adorned the walls.
From the windows she gazed upon the wide valley,
encircled by its mountains, the shining Rhine, and many
towns and villages. On leaving her room she gazed into
the depths of the mighty forest of beech-trees, which
resounded with the song of birds. She spread crumbs
and seeds before her door and window, and flocks of
feathered guests assembled around her. Lost in thought,
she watched the happy, careless ways of the birds, and
lived in the world her fancy created, becoming quite
apathetic after the terrible shocks she had lately gone
through. Her anxious mother gladly allowed Princess
Elizabeth to accompany the Grand Duchess to Ouchy
in the autumn. A great change came over her there.
She writes: “Unknown to me, a different spirit came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
over me and aroused me from my melancholy, into
which, however, I relapsed all the deeper afterwards.”</p>

<p>From the autumn of 1864 to the New Year a young
Swiss girl spent many months at Monrepos. Maria von
Sulzer was a very amiable girl, and the depth of her
mind and her ideal tenderness had soon won her the
heart of the young Princess. They were like two sisters
together, and shared all their interests. The intercourse
with her young friend had put fresh life into Princess
Elizabeth. A stay at Arolsen varied the winter. There,
after the birth of five daughters, the princely house of
Waldeck had welcomed their first son. Princess Elizabeth
had the pleasure of carrying her little cousin, the
hereditary Prince of Waldeck, at his baptism.</p>

<p>“The Castle of Neuwied is so melancholy that I do
not like to look at it any more. Each closed window
reminds me of some one that is dead. It will be a good
thing when it again echoes with youthful steps and the
voices of children who know nothing of the old sorrows
and sufferings, and think that their little feet are the
first to tread the ground, and that it never was otherwise
than they know it. If only the old walls could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
tell their histories! Your children shall once listen
astonished when Aunt Elsa tells them how she lived
there&mdash;laughed and wept; and that she once was just
as small and had just the same thoughts as they, or
perhaps different ones, but they were very beautiful.
How she thought that a maiden was something very
wonderful till she became one herself, and yet remained
exactly what she was before!</p>

<p>“Uncle Max told me of his youth yesterday, and how
six horses were often brought round to the door. He
and his brothers swung themselves upon them, and they
galloped away laughing and cheering. Then he gave a
melancholy look at the desolate house, and tears came
into his eyes. Our youth was different, more serious and
sadder; but then our manhood and womanhood will be
different, rich and blessed and full of power and love.”</p>

<p>“For I must confess to you that I am, like papa, a
most sociable person, and know nothing more charming
than an agreeable salon where, besides, good music
is being performed. My greatest wish is once to possess
so much money that I can always have a circle of artists
and savants about me, and make it as pleasant as possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>

myself, for I cannot do that at all, but only try to bring

<p>Meanwhile the widowed Princess of Wied made use of
her practical talents by attending to the affairs of her
son, who had not yet attained his majority. Prince
William had left the College at Basle, and was now to
start on a journey to the East (1865&ndash;1866). His
mother had asked the Crown Prince of Prussia to recommend
a military gentleman to her to accompany the
Prince on his travels. He named his friend and playfellow,
General Mischke, who was then a captain. The
architect, Professor Kachel, who afterwards became
Director of the Schools of Art in Carlsruhe, was the
Prince’s scientific companion. Accompanied by these
two gentlemen the Prince travelled through Italy to
Egypt. There he met Prince Anton of Hohenzollern,
and they proceeded together on their journey through
Syria and Palestine, Constantinople and Greece. In
Athens, however, they received orders to join the army,
and hurried back to Germany, where the Prince of
Wied was attached to the staff of the Crown Prince.
The war with Austria was soon over, but Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Anton of Hohenzollern was not to see his country
again. He died of his wounds soon after the battle of
Königgratz.</p>

<p>During the months of February and March 1866
Princess Elizabeth was at Wiesbaden, on a visit to her
uncle, the Duke of Nassau. Here she took singing
lessons and learnt to play the zither, and was very happy.
In May the Princess of Wied visited her relations at
Braunfels, Laubach, and Schlitz, with Princess Elizabeth.
The young Princess was charmed with the fine castles
surrounded by the fresh green of the woods. She often
said&mdash;“The mediatised Princes have the best of and lead
the happiest lives. I should never wish for more than a
castle in a wood, where I could do much good, and receive
the friends I love. That is the most enviable fate.”</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1866 Princess Elizabeth again
accompanied the Grand Duchess Hélène on her travels,
and this time they went to Ragaz, and whilst there they
saw much of General von Moltke, then at the height of
his glorious career. He joined in their games of bowls
in the morning, and various <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jeux d’esprit</i> of an evening,
with the utmost amiability and simplicity, and Princess
Elizabeth became much attached to this so eminent and
distinguished man. Whilst discussing the political situation
they spoke of Prince Charles of Hohenzollern, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
had been chosen as Sovereign Prince of Roumania shortly
before the outbreak of the war between Prussia and
Austria. A few years before this General von Moltke
had made a scientific journey through Silesia with the
Crown Prince and Prince Charles. “That young Prince
of Hohenzollern will make his mark and become talked
about” were then the prophetic words of the Field-Marshal.</p>

<p>The Grand Duchess had finished her cure. They
were to leave Ragaz in a few days. Princess Elizabeth
was to return to Monrepos, but a letter from her mother
changed her plans. Her favourite cousin, Catherine of
Oldenburg, had died at Venice. The sufferings of her
mother, Princess Thérèse, increased after the death of her
lovely daughter, and the doctors urged a sojourn in the
south of Italy upon her. She besought her sister, the
Princess of Wied, to allow Princess Elizabeth, for whom
she had conceived a great affection in St. Petersburg, to
accompany her. Although it was hard for the young
Princess to extend the separation from her mother for
many months, her resolution was soon taken. She
hoped to find scope for her energies in this family circle.
In September 1866 they travelled to Rome, where they
remained a short time, and to Naples. At first Princess
Thérèse had taken an apartment in an hotel for many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
months. But though they kept away from all society,
it was noisy and uncomfortable on account of the traffic
in the crowded streets. Princess Elizabeth, who was
accustomed to a quiet room and quiet hours, felt it
particularly. Her cousins too were always surrounding
her, and did not leave her a moment’s peace. “I gave
myself up to melancholy reflections,” she writes to her
mother. But all changed for the better when they
took a villa on the Pausilipp. Here she took up her
regular occupations, and writes: “I have work, much
work; for those that seek it, find it. The beauties of
nature and the mild air constantly renew my strength.”
She now gave her cousin, Thesa of Oldenburg, lessons in
German, English, and arithmetic, and says: “My intentions
are good and true, and a blessing may perhaps rest
upon them. Nor shall I be melancholy any more, when
I am in the treadmill of regular work.” Her poems
written at this time are mostly grave and full of religious
thoughts, but sometimes the brightness of youth overpowers
her, and cheerful, happy songs flow from her pen.</p>

“<span class="smcap">Naples, Santa Brigitta</span>, <i>19th January 1867</i>.

<p>“Yesterday we moved here. The sirocco has been
blowing for some days, and the wild waves of the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
are foaming. The seagulls are skimming between the
spray, which is thrown up to a great height, and last
night the storm shook our house. The clouds are low,
and cover the peaks of Vesuvius, while wind and rain
beat through our windows and make weird music.
The sea is green and grey, the white foam shines like
phosphorus. It is just what I like. I should love to
go out alone in the storm to let it rage about me, to
sing a wild song to the waves, which nobody listens
to or hears, and which remains my own, though I sing
it loudly. Then I should come home as quiet as a lamb,
and listen to the storm no more. Now the bank of
clouds is rolled away, and a rosy light spreads itself
quietly over the foaming, angry sea. It spreads itself
further and further from the horizon to our feet, soothing
and shining, and brings happy thoughts to my heart.
If that would learn to be still it could also command the
storm, and in its depths it is still. For through all, my
quiet home is the anchor which holds me fast, the
haven which receives me when my sails are rent. Man
belongs to nature, and is her greatest and completest
work, and therefore we love and have confidence in men,
even when they are passionate and excited.”</p>

<p>“<i>20th January.</i>&mdash;As we woke to-day upon our hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
the sun shone upon the sea, which is like a sheet
of glass. The doors and windows are wide open, and
the soft air of May pervades me and our rooms, and
brings in happy and cheerful thoughts. It has wakened
all my pleasure in life and power of work. When I
raise my head the mighty Vesuvius is spread before me,
and its peaks lost in the clouds. To the left I look
down to the town, which shines below me in the sun.
The sea spreads itself to my right, with the sharp points
of the Island of Capri. For the first time Naples
appears to me magically beautiful, for the first time
I can gaze undisturbed upon the grand beauty of nature
here. Peace, which I have not felt for a long time,
steals into my heart. I feel as if I could swing myself
into the light air as if I had a hundred wings which
drew me to the sun, as if new life came to me. It is
worth battling with the storm to feel such heavenly
peace. Even the waves of the sea are hushed as though
they feared to break the stillness. Everything seems
to me to call, ‘Peace, Peace.’ It is too beautiful
for words, and the joy is too deep; it is like a song of
thanksgiving, a golden dream from which we would
not wake. My little cousin walks up and down in the
next room and hums a tune. The beautiful world has
had a good influence upon her also, for the clouds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
which lay upon her brow have vanished. I should
like to write nothing more than the perpetual refrain,
Peace has returned. A fly is buzzing at my window
as though it were midsummer, and a bird is chirping in
the distance. I allow nature to charm me and to caress
me like her spoiled child. Do not fear my becoming
dreamy and idle: I am only dreaming with you. The
instant the pen leaves my hand the cares of daily life
surround me with a thousand claims, which have all
to be satisfied. I may not dream long, so grant me
these few moments. I only draw myself up like a
wave before it rushes onwards and gathers strength
for the work which I have taken in hand. I never
forget for a moment that I have two hours’ lessons to
give to this spoilt child the day after to-morrow. I
am quite prepared for it. I feel that though she may
learn more from any schoolmaster than from me, I can
perhaps influence her mode of thought by these lessons,
which will be of more use to her than the deepest
learning. I try to teach her, what you taught, to love
people for whom you have no sympathy. If I do not
marry, I shall pass my examination as a teacher. To
that I have made up my mind. Tell Pastor Harder
that I have never lost sight of this object, though I am
driven hither and thither. For I must accomplish this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
which has been in my mind for years. And though I
sometimes feel that I am presumptuous and arrogant,
I usually think the contrary. ‘Your vocation is what
calls you’ is all that I have remembered of Brentano’s
fairy tales, and what calls me is teaching. I wait in
patience. If I have understood it wrongly, it will be
made clear to me. Here I have that lot assigned to
me. I teach for ten hours a week, and am present at all
the lessons given. Tell the Pastor that I am constantly
repeating his good maxims, and hope to prove myself
his worthy scholar.”</p>

<p>We see that Princess Elizabeth is ambitious in the
best sense of the word. “Thus she is impelled to
teach, for in teaching lies great power.”</p>

<p>“<i>Naples, 5th February 1867.</i>&mdash;Aunt Thekla has died,
and Uncle Max has died. It is worth while to have
lived as he did, and he does not die unmourned. Indeed
it was a beautiful death, which one might wish to
have after so rich a life. I pray God that I may die
mourned after a life of labour, even though I should
have no children and grandchildren. The life of Uncle
Max was rich and full of interest. I think it was
beautiful.”</p>

<p>“<i>Naples, 3rd April 1867.</i>&mdash;Sometimes I feel so old,
but not sorrowful&mdash;no! quite the contrary. I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
like to be much, much older, to have the duties and the
rights of an old maid. I often feel as if I had had a
mist before my eyes lately. The happiness to have
spent time and strength where they are most needed
is too great. I am not at all afraid of that dreadful
word ‘old maid.’ I share it with many whom I have
often envied for their strong though quiet influence.
Work is what I must and will have, and then all can
say of me, ‘That is a happy girl.’ The time is soon
over. It has gone by quickly, very quickly. God
knows that I had the wish to do some good, to
accomplish something, and have some influence. I see
no results, but that I did not expect. Perhaps a
little trace may be left behind. I am not so proud as
to think that I can carry all before me like a mountain
torrent. Perhaps I am but a little drop, but if Heaven
has let me fall on the right place, I can joyfully become
absorbed by the sunbeams!”</p>

<p>In May 1867 Princess Elizabeth was overjoyed to
return to Monrepos. “She returned to her quiet
home in the forest and became a child once more.”
But it was not for long. The amiable niece had
become necessary to the Grand Duchess Hélène, and
she was constantly enticing her away from home.
In August we find her again in Carlsbad with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
aunt. The Grand Duchess was very unwell, and Princess
Elizabeth had to receive the ladies and gentlemen
who came to pay their respects. She writes as follows
about her impressions and the people who frequented
<span class="locked">there:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“<i>Carlsbad, 2nd August 1867.</i>&mdash;I have in these last
days made the acquaintance of some people with whom
I am so enchanted that I am constantly wishing you
were here. First comes Frau Arnemann, a Norwegian
lady, with bright black eyes, which fascinate one. She
has always been with artists, and her life has been
rich but sad. Her impressions of people are quite
extraordinarily correct, and I have often seen astonishing
proofs of her clairvoyance. She is quite magnetic.
Frau Arnemann introduced the painter Piloty to us, a
very amiable and refined person. We go into raptures
over Italy together. Then we have got to know the
great singer, Frau Unger-Sabatier, who is here with
her pupil and niece, Fräulein Regan. Frau Unger-Sabatier
is a perfect artist, wise and clear-headed, with
the sacred fire and yet not too much of the fervour of
the dilettanti. Her great pleasure is to train young
singers. Her niece, Fräulein Regan, is twenty-three.
Her voice is like a flute, and she sings to wonderful
perfection. She is also a very cultivated girl, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
speaks French and Italian not only well but beautifully,
and understands and renders the songs perfectly. I
feel myself drawn to her as to a magnet.”</p>

<p>Her intercourse with Edith von Rahden was also a
great pleasure to the Princess. She says of her: “Edith
has become more mild and gentle than ever, and esteems
every one, irrespective of their position towards herself.”
“I know how to be grateful for every happy hour, and what
greater happiness is there than to be treated as a friend
by a woman of experience.” Later the Princess Elizabeth
writes to her mother: “If ever I made up my mind to a
marriage, I should like to have a settled home, a house
on my own property, and not to begin a wandering life,
which never takes firm root anywhere. I do not now
seek my vocation where it seems difficult and troublesome,
and have no other wish than to live quietly and
work where I can.”</p>

<p>Among the gentlemen who were about the Grand
Duchess at that time was Walujeff, a Russian Minister,
Tolstoi, Rouher, Piloty, Count Keyserlingk, the Curator
of the University of Dorpat, and the Privy Councillor
Von Brevern, “who is of a refined and very sensitive
nature. His kindness brings thoughts to me which I
should scarcely like to mention.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Maria von Sulzer had married her cousin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
and had come to Monrepos in the summer in a very
suffering state. There her strength declined visibly.
Feeling that her death was near, she had a great longing
to return home. Shortly afterwards the Princess
of Wied received news of her death. We read in the
journal of Princess Elizabeth of the 4th of September:&mdash;“Maria
Sulzer has died. Death is but an old friend to
me, a serious friend, and yet kind, if one knows how to
meet him. Heaven sends me countless blessings every
day. Indeed I cannot repine. For my life is rich and
full, which I constantly repeat to myself. And if all the
loved ones were to be taken, it would still be blessed a
thousandfold, for still all are mine. Even if the flowers
fade, we do not forget that they once bloomed, and
that we enjoyed their sweet perfume. Indeed my heart
bleeds, but still I am abundantly blessed.”</p>

<p>We find the following poem on the death of this
beloved <span class="locked">friend:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>From Carlsbad the Grand Duchess travelled with her
great niece to the great Exhibition at Paris. There
Princess Elizabeth had arrived unwell; she suffered
from a bad throat and momentary deafness. Consequently
she could not enjoy the great sights with her
usual freshness. The reception at the Tuileries, visits
to the Exhibition, to the Louvre and the neighbouring
castles, seemed like a dream to her. Under the impression
of this deafness, and inclining as ever to
melancholy thoughts, she writes to her mother&mdash;“I have
often thought in these last days that one can well do
without occupation in old age. Then we can sit in our
arm-chair, lost in thoughts, quite still, and without prejudice.
One can think sweetly of the dead, and tell
those around one of our past life as a curiosity. I fancy
it very beautiful. I would not change now, for I would
taste of life with all it brings, and hope to toil and
endeavour. But all the time I shall look forward to the
peace of old age.”</p>

<p>The suffering state of the Grand Duchess Hélène
necessitated another sojourn in Ragaz, but she would
not let her niece leave her side. It was the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
September before they arrived, and few visitors were
there. This quiet they found very refreshing after the
noisy bustle and moral tension of Paris. The young
Princess became quite herself again. Her restless mind
immediately undertook new work.</p>

<p>“Last night,” she writes on the 22nd September 1867,
“I was telling Fräulein von Rahden so much about our
lost little brother (Prince Otto) that she exclaimed&mdash;‘His
life must be written. It will be a great blessing for all
who read it.’ She told me to write as fully as possible,
and said that what was written in the greatest simplicity
must, if it comes from the heart, find an echo in the
hearts of others. I have wished to do this for years,
and felt that I ought to do it, and found it too difficult.
I really think that the moment has come now. I should
like to add a detailed memoir to our archives.</p>

<p>“I have just come from the little church, in which I
heard a beautiful sermon. Pfarrer Steiger preached from
Jer. ix. 24, ‘For in these things I delight, saith the
Lord.’ It was full of enthusiasm, and suitable to my
state of mind, which was rather sad, as many memories
awake here in Ragaz. And then this good man brought
God’s healing, conquering, and inspiring love so near to
us that I nearly wept for joy. It was too beautiful. I
seemed to hear Maria Sulzer’s voice saying to me, ‘Lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
yourself in the arms of God.’ I have already thought
of writing prayers for our church, but I am not sufficiently
advanced. Perhaps I shall be able to do so
when I am writing Otto’s Memoirs.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ragaz, 30th September.</i>&mdash;Thinking of our little
services, I have written the enclosed prayers. Perhaps
you can use them. I have also begun Otto’s Memoirs,
and have written to Nana (Prince Otto’s English nurse)
and begged her to give me details of his earliest childhood,
‘If with all your hearts ye truly seek Me, ye
shall ever surely find Me, saith the Lord.’ I should like
to inscribe this text on every page. I should like to
seek and find Him. I have never really loved Him. Frau
Arnemann says: ‘God is drawing me to Him through
all that I love, and whom He has taken to Himself.’
How gladly I will let myself be drawn! This winter I
shall stay at home, and look forward to it much. I
have my hands full of business too, for when I have
finished my translation of Carlyle I have a new plan.
Frau Arnemann always wished me to write a book for
children. Only I cannot think of anything suitable.
I can only write about what I have lived through and
felt.”</p>

<p>After many fine days, during which walks of three or
four hours were undertaken, a sudden and lasting fall of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
snow had induced the Grand Duchess to leave Ragaz.
Princess Elizabeth now returned home. She spent the
winter quietly and happily with her mother at Monrepos.
“I look back upon this time with particular pleasure,”
she writes; “I think of the dreamy hours spent in the
little room, of the endless conversations on deep subjects
with Fräulein Lavater, and of the evenings when our
spinning wheels hummed and my brother read aloud to
us.” In the summer of 1868 she travelled to Sweden
on a visit to her royal relations. She calls Sweden the
land of poetry; and the magnificence of nature there,
and the beautiful legends which are attached to every
stone, inspired her fancy. She liked to be in the north,
and delighted in Stockholm. The magnificent town is
enthroned like a queen of the waters on her islands
between the lake and the sea. It is surrounded by
many oaks of a hundred years’ growth, which are the
masts and pennons of the ships, and historical treasures
of all sorts. “We made a wonderful expedition to the
Malarsee. The Duke of Ostgothland, the present King
Oscar II., had taken a ship, and we glided on the shining
sea between a hundred emerald isles to the curious
old castle of Grypsholm. What added immensely to the
charm of our voyage were the songs of the Swedish
officers, whom my uncle invited for our amusement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
These gentlemen sing nearly the whole day, and songs
varied according to the places we passed. Their voices
were as clear as bells, whispering mysteriously or
sounding loud in the uncontrollable joy of youth. My
uncle had the tombs of the kings in the Riddersholmskirche
open for us to see. Each dynasty has a
separate vault. I laid my hand upon the coffins of
Gustav Adolph and Karl XII., but could not help
shuddering before these open graves. The drive
through the country to Helsingborg was very fine. We
passed more than a hundred seas. The red wooden
houses and the castles built of red tiles are picturesquely
situated between the huge blocks of stone of volcanic
origin with which the whole country is strewn. These
blocks are covered with beech and fir trees. We spent
a night in Toncoping, and wandered through the bright
wooden town, by the shining Wettersee, at five in the
morning.”</p>

<p>With the facility peculiar to her, Princess Elizabeth
learnt Swedish, and could soon read “Tegner’s Frithjofsage”
and the beautiful poems of Runeberg in the
original. The Princess of Wied had spent three months
in Sweden with her daughter. On the way back they
visited Copenhagen and Friedrichsborg, and stayed some
days with their relations at Arolsen. There Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Elizabeth was a peculiar favourite of her cousins of
Waldeck, and her appearance at Arolsen gave the signal
to endless rejoicings.</p>

<p>Princess Elizabeth had scarcely returned to Monrepos
with her mother when the Grand Duchess Hélène called
her niece to her side at Heidelberg. In November of
1868 she spent three most enjoyable weeks there. The
recollections of this time were so deep and lasting that
Princess Elizabeth, then Princess of Roumania, mentions
it nine years after with such life and freshness as if
years and great changes had not come over her meanwhile.
We will here give that part of a letter written
from Bucharest in May 1877:&mdash;</p>

<p>“How beautiful it must now be in Heidelberg!
Have I not spent almost the happiest three weeks of my
life there with my aunt and so many distinguished people.
A gathering of great thinkers, Kirchhoff, Friedreich,
Bluntschli, Treitschke, Gervinus, and Helmholtz in
one drawing-room! Besides which Joachim with his
heavenly violin, and Frau Joachim with her voice like a
mountain torrent. An evening for the gods! and then
those walks with Fräulein von Rahden, those dreams in
the ruins. How they seemed to teem with life and
flitting forms, with banquets and fair women. Indeed
those were visions worthy of the gods! Of course we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
were often wet through, but I think the rain belongs to
Heidelberg as the dew to flowers. You should read the
‘Trompeter’ together, that suits there, ‘Frau Aventiure,’
and ‘Gaudeamus.’ One must become as jolly as the
students, drink wine and lounge, in order to be in the
right spirit for Heidelberg: then it is a magic circle, a
land of dreams, such as weary wayfarers may long for.
You breathe so freely in the warm damp air.”</p>

<p>With these bright impressions the year 1868 closed.
The next year was to be one of great importance for
Princess Elizabeth. But although her immediate future
shaped itself in an unexpected manner, it found her
prepared for it as to an object towards which the genius
of her life was tending. We have interwoven many
extracts of Princess Elizabeth’s letters in the course of
our narrative, because a natural and unsought for likeness
of her is thus developed. Her words are a picture
of her inner and outer life according to the impression
made upon her mind at the time. She describes the
effects of what she experienced more than the causes,
but these effects are not problematic states of mind, but
strong and lasting impressions, which take root in a
nature rich in refined feelings, and increase its wealth.
And there is one theme which traverses this inner life
and shows itself even there, where it is not openly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
mentioned&mdash;an all pervading principle, which has the
strength to avoid and to overcome the two dangers
which beset the life of a daughter of a Prince. One
danger is that she may give herself up to the enjoyment
of her exalted rank; the other that intellectual pursuits
are undertaken in a dilettanti spirit and become superficial.
There is only one safeguard to these two dangers,
and that is duty and labour. The duty of a Prince is
to rule&mdash;that is the highest form of education. Now
we read in the letters of Princess Elizabeth even there,
where she does not say so in so many words: “I wish
to have a profession.” She meant the profession of
a teacher, and she received one of a Princess and a
Queen!</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">On</span> the 2nd of January 1869 we read in the
Journal of Princess Elizabeth: “A song
of thanksgiving only for the past warm
and happy year. I have no wish for the
coming one but that the work of my hands may be
blessed. It is nine years since I wrote the first words
in my book. I have noted the days of my youth in it,
sometimes with a heart full of sacred feelings, sometimes
in bright happiness, often in sadness and sorrow. My
early years have been rich&mdash;rich in love, in sunshine, and
many trials. I have always been saved from one thing,
and that is, to be bereft of all joy. This weight has
never fallen on my heart, and so I am still young and
strong, and look forward to middle age with joy and
pleasure. If only Heaven will continue to grant me the
power of writing poetry, I will guard and keep it as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
sacred shrine. I do nothing to cultivate the gift, in
order not to become vain. I only beg that it may live
on for me and in me, and pray for the freshness of youth,
which is necessary for writing a poem from one’s heart.
Adieu you beautiful year, and may the New Year look
in kindly upon my room and my heart. ‘Tout ou rien’
shall be my motto.”</p>

<p>Prince William of Wied had meanwhile served his
year at Coblentz in the regiment of Queen Augusta, and
studied at the University of Bonn for a year and a half.
On the 30th of March 1869 the coming of age of the
young Prince was celebrated at Neuwied with great
festivities. In August of the same year he was betrothed
to Princess Marie of the Netherlands, daughter of His
Royal Highness Prince Frederick of the Netherlands
and Princess Louise of Prussia, a sister of the German
Emperor. Still Princess Elizabeth would hear of no
proposal of marriage. Her highest ambition was her
wish to be a schoolmistress; she thought of founding a
school, and giving up her time and strength to teaching.
Her mother had let her have her way, and had already
secretly planned and arranged everything. The Princess
of Wied insisted on one point, however, which was, that
Princess Elizabeth should follow a strict course of study
and pass her examination as a teacher before her plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
could be practically carried out. Princess Elizabeth’s
restless spirit had calmed down in this prospect. Her
mother remarked to Fräulein Lavater: “You will see
that she will marry now; it would have been too soon
before.” As the Princess of Wied was spending a few
weeks at Bonn with her daughter in the spring of this
year, she received an invitation from the Prince of
Hohenzollern to visit him at Düsseldorf. She guessed
at the deep meaning of this amiable invitation, but
Princess Elizabeth was quite unconscious of it, and was
only looking forward to seeing her beloved Princess of
Hohenzollern, and Princess Marie, with whom she had
corresponded intimately since she had been so much with
them at Berlin. The princely parents now wished to
become better acquainted with the young Princess of
Wied, for their son, the Prince of Roumania, was thinking
of uniting himself to her in marriage.</p>

<p>Prince Charles I. of Roumania, the second son of
Prince Anthony of Hohenzollern and the Princess of
Baden, was born on the 20th of April 1839, and
educated in Dresden at the Blochmann Institute. He
wished to follow a military career, and entered the
Prussian army, with which he went through the Danish
campaign of 1864. In the year 1866 the young lieutenant
of Dragoon Guards, who was then only seven and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
twenty, was called to the throne of Roumania by the
unanimous voice of the nation. The King of Prussia, as
head of the family, not objecting, and sure of the concurrence
of Napoleon III., whose influence was then predominant
in the lands of the Danube, Prince Charles
became the reigning Prince of Roumania. The country
entrusted to him had already visibly improved as well in
spiritual as in temporal matters during his short reign.
But the low state of social conditions required reform.
A Princess was wanted to help in this great work whose
life and example would do much to ensure success.</p>

<p>The Prince’s choice fell on the Princess Elizabeth,
whose acquaintance he had made at Berlin, and whom
he had learnt to know more intimately through her
letters to his sister. From the time of the Prince’s
nomination to the Roumanian throne Princess Elizabeth
had displayed a great interest in him. Her active
nature was sympathetic to the thorough seriousness
and energy with which Prince Charles had undertaken
and carried through his arduous task. The affairs of
Roumania were not strange to her either, for one of her
French governesses had lived there for some time, and
told her a great deal about it. Once, long before the
betrothal, when Elizabeth’s friends had besieged her
with all sorts of plans, and wished to see her on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
throne, she had answered in fun: “The only throne
which could attract me is the Roumanian, for there
would be much for me to do.”</p>

<p>A short time after the visit to Düsseldorf, the
Princess of Wied was asked to arrange a personal
meeting between her daughter and Prince Charles. To
have such a meeting in Monrepos seemed too public,
and consequently it suited Her Serene Highness’s view
exactly when Princess Elizabeth expressed a great
wish to attend a concert which Clara Schumann and
Stockhausen were to give at Cologne in October. The
Princess of Wied consequently arranged to go to
Cologne, and there receive Prince Charles, who was
then at Paris. They alighted at the Hotel du Nord.
The hours passed, and the Prince had not appeared.
So the two ladies drove with their suite to the Botanical
Gardens to dine. The meal was over, and Princess
Elizabeth had not noticed that they had for some time
been closely observed by a group of gentlemen. Two of
these then advanced to the Princess of Wied, and the
Prince of Roumania was introduced to her. Elizabeth,
who knew nothing of his intentions, or of the previous
arrangement, reached out both hands to him with undisguised
satisfaction, saying: “How glad I am that we
should thus meet here by chance.” They remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
together many hours in the Botanical and Zoological
Gardens, engaged in deep conversation. Returned to
the hotel, Princess Elizabeth exclaimed enthusiastically:
“What a delightful man the Prince has become!”</p>

<p>Whilst she was dressing for the concert, the Prince
had an interview with her mother, and asked for her
sanction to the marriage. Princess Elizabeth meanwhile
was only thinking of the musical treat which was awaiting
her, and was much vexed at the Prince remaining
so long. When he at last left, she rushed from her
room to the salon, saying in a reproachful tone: “But,
mamma.” But the young girl remained transfixed on
the doorstep, for she saw the earnest and deeply moved
expression of her mother’s countenance, who advanced
towards her, embracing her tenderly, and said: “The
Prince of Roumania has made you an offer of marriage,
my child.”</p>

<p>The surprise of her daughter was great, but after
these few words it became clear to her that the Prince
had, unconsciously to herself, won her whole heart.
When her mother repeated the question, if she did not
wish to have time to consider, she answered simply and
decidedly: “No; he had better come at once&mdash;I know I
shall love him much.” And when the Prince came and
greeted her as his bride, she said to him with her soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
and sympathetic voice: “It makes me both proud and
humble at the same time.” The same night the Prince
had to return to Paris. But Princess Elizabeth wrote
in her Journal of the 12th of October: “I am betrothed
and a blissfully happy bride.”</p>

<p>Four days later, on the 16th of October, Prince Charles
arrived at Neuwied, accompanied by five Roumanian
gentlemen, to celebrate his betrothal publicly. Everything
had been so suddenly and unexpectedly settled
that none of the many members of the family of Wied
could be present on the occasion. The Princess of Wied,
Prince William, and some intimate friends of their family,
were the only guests, excepting the Roumanian suite.</p>

<p>Simply, and without any particular ceremony, the
betrothal was celebrated by an exchange of rings.
There was a state dinner in the evening. Towards the
close of it, the Princess of Wied arose, and though
struggling with repressed emotion, spoke the following
words in a clear and firm voice: “Let us drink to the
health of the future pair, who are to-day the object of
our united best wishes! Every betrothal is certainly a
day of rejoicing. But the betrothal of to-day is more.
A Prince, called to the accomplishment of a high and
arduous mission, has chosen a bride who, whilst remaining
faithfully at his side, will take part in the fulfilment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
of this great duty. They have made a holy covenant between
themselves, in which they have promised to devote
their strength and love to the happiness of a people which,
if rightly and wisely led, is called to a great and happy
future. And we will herewith also express our warmest
and most sincere good wishes for the fulfilment of this
our hope.”</p>

<p>After Prince William had brought out a toast to the
union of the two princely houses, and the Prince of
Roumania had expressed his thanks for the good wishes
of all present, he added: “This day is the happiest of
my life, for it has allowed me to find a bride who will
stand by me in loving devotion during the fulfilment of
the high mission which a whole nation has entrusted to
me.” On the day of his betrothal the Prince had said
to his bride: “You will have a noble duty in life. You
can comfort when I am too severe, and can gently pray
for all.” One of the relations wrote to the Princess of
Wied: “We can congratulate the bridegroom on taking
home a bride who will be a help and a blessing for his
country. It would be difficult to find such another:
I rejoice that Elizabeth’s sphere is not to be contracted
into the small household circle of the woman. Her
character will enlarge and expand in the large circle of
interest which awaits her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
The Princess of Wied now travelled with the bride
to Baden-Baden, to introduce her to the King and
Queen of Prussia, as head of the house of Hohenzollern,
then to the Weinburg by Siegmaringen, whither Prince
Charles had preceded her, and conducted their future
daughter-in-law to the Prince and Princess of Hohenzollern.
Prince Charles gave to his bride, amongst
other things, an album for her Journal of Poems, and
wrote on the first page: “Weinburg, 26th October
1869. Love is returned by love. Meet your people with
the same love and confidence that you have shown to me,
and then it will not be one heart alone which beats for
you, but millions of hearts will unite with that one, and
I shall deem myself happy, for you will not belong to
me alone. A whole nation has a right to you. An
entire people looks up to you with confidence, and will
return your love by its devotion.”</p>

<p>Prince Charles announced his engagement in the
following words to the Roumanian nation: “When I
accepted a throne which the love and confidence of a
whole nation entrusted to me, I understood that the
uppermost thought in the unanimous election of a
foreign Prince must be to establish a lasting dynasty
in Roumania. To-day I have the happiness to announce
to my people a guarantee for law and order, of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
it stands in such need, whilst I inform the nation that
I am betrothed to Princess Elizabeth of Wied, who was
born on the 29th of December 1843.” This very
important event called out much enthusiasm in the
whole country. Bucharest and Jassy were illuminated,
and a <i>Te Deum</i> held in the cathedrals. Addresses of
congratulations poured in from all sides. From the
plains of the Danube to the vine-clad banks of the
Rhine the electric wire endlessly repeated the winged
words&mdash;“God save Carol I., ruler of the Roumanians.”
“God save the Princess Elizabeth his bride.” A month
later, on the 15th of November, the wedding was to be
celebrated with much pomp and etiquette.</p>

<p>The Queen of Prussia had announced herself. A few
days previously we read in the <span class="locked">Journal&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“<i>Monrepos, 12th November 1869.</i>&mdash;My lines have
fallen on pleasant places&mdash;a fair inheritance is mine.”</p>

<p>On the 13th of November Prince Charles arrived in
Neuwied, and was received with great enthusiasm. Guests
streamed in from all sides. On the 14th of November
the family of the Prince of Hohenzollern-Siegmaringen
arrived, also the Count and Countess of Flanders, the
reigning Prince of Waldeck, the Grand Duchess of
Baden, Princess William of Baden, Prince Waldemar
of Schleswig-Holstein-Augustenburg, the Princess and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
Counts of Solms-Braunfels, Laubach, and Rödelheim,
with their consorts. The Queen of Prussia arrived
on the wedding day. The Emperors of France and
Germany were represented by their ambassadors,
M. d’Oubril and Count Moosburg. The princely party
were attended by numerous suites of German and
Roumanian ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p>On the 15th of November the sun arose in great
splendour over Neuwied. It shone upon an animated
picture. The palace and every single house in the town
was decorated with flags and garlands. The neighbourhood
of the palace, the garden, and the extensive park
had been filled with groups of people since daybreak.
They had come to see the bride once more. It is a
peculiarity in the nature of the German people that they
share the joys and sorrows of their Princes, and regard
their concerns as their own. This hereditary affection
between the Princess of Wied and the inhabitants of
Neuwied has not disappeared, but has been faithfully
preserved, and remained mutual. Consequently they
felt that day as if a great family event were being
celebrated in their midst. They were all heartily
interested on this occasion. Was it not in honour of
their beloved Princess Elizabeth, who was as well known
in the houses of the poor and distressed as in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
whom God had blessed with earthly treasures? Forty
young ladies of Neuwied presented Princess Elizabeth
with a beautiful carpet which they had worked. The
local newspaper conveyed the congratulations of the
citizens in expressive verses. All the members of the
community rejoiced.</p>

<p>At half-past five the marriage procession started, and
proceeded to a saloon which had been arranged as a
Catholic chapel. The priest delivered a short address,
rings were exchanged, and the young pair received the
blessing of the Church upon their knees. After this
the stately procession proceeded down the grand staircase
in the same order as it came to a hall below, which
Prince William had tastefully and richly arranged as a
Protestant chapel. The vast hall swam in a sea of
light. On the right and left of it galleries had been
arranged, which had already for some time been filled
by the officials and inhabitants of Neuwied and the
neighbourhood, who had been invited to the ceremony.
In the depth of the chapel a small wing had been built
out to contain the altar on this occasion, upon which a
simple cross was placed. Music sounded at the entrance
of the young pair. Thereupon Pfarrer Lohmann
turned to the betrothed and spoke touching words to
them, which deeply moved all present. He had chosen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
his text from Ruth i. 16, 17: “Whither thou
goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge:
thy people shall be my people, and thy God my
God. Where thou diest, I will die, and there will I
be buried.” The important “Yes” was spoken by the
Princess in unfaltering tone. Her experience in the
home of her parents had taught her that a family
becomes more closely bound together by sorrow and trial.
But she had sealed her promise with a happy heart.
“I am wholly thine, wherever thy way may lead me.”
“Only they who have experienced such a thrilling
moment can understand how overpowering and how
blessed it is, and how joyfully the sacrifice is made.”
(From the Wedding Discourse.) The august young pair
made the sacred promise on their knees, exchanged
rings, and received a blessing. The thunder of cannons
announced that the marriage of the Princess of Wied
and the Prince of Roumania was concluded.</p>

<p>After the sacred ceremony a reception was held at
the palace to receive the congratulations of all, and a
state dinner was served at six. The Queen of Prussia
had brought out the first toast to the newly married
pair, and salutes from the cannons, German and Roumanian
National Hymns, and speeches, &amp;c., animated
the banquet. Meanwhile a general illumination lighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
up the streets of Neuwied. To the most distant
suburbs the houses were decked with flags and garlands,
draperies and transparencies.</p>

<p>The youthful pair then drove through the town,
amidst the hearty cheers of the people, and accompanied
by their august guests. The cheers that welcomed
them were not official. They sounded like greetings
of joy and blessing. And not only the town of
Neuwied, but the whole principality, shared in the
enthusiasm of that festive day. Hearty cheers for the
princely pair resounded from all sides, and seventy-four
places in the principality of Wied had sent in addresses
of congratulations on that day.</p>

<p>The Prince of Roumania and his bride were afterwards
conducted to Monrepos, where they spent the
remaining time, which the Princess was to pass in her
old home. The following day the young pair gave a
family dinner party. The municipality and the leading
citizens had arranged a brilliant ball for that
evening in their honour. On the second day the
princely family gave a concert in the new concert hall,
where Otto von Konigslaw performed with the famous
Quartette of Cologne, and the band of the Queen
of Prussia’s Regiment assisted. After the concert a
magnificent display of fireworks took place in front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
the castle. And so the people of Neuwied saw the
Princess whom they had so fondly named “Our
Elizabeth” for the last time in her own home. And
she has remained “Our Elizabeth” to them till the
present day, and is received in the same enthusiastic
manner when she returns amongst them.</p>

<p>The young pair had started on their journey to
Roumania on the 18th of November. With happy
confidence Princess Elizabeth followed the husband of
her choice. No political reasons, but a true union of
their hearts, had united them. Stern duties awaited
them in the unknown land. But they encountered
them unflinchingly and zealously. A poem which was
published five years after in her first work, styled
“Roumanian Poetry,” shows that in her new home
she thought of her own country with unaltered
affection.</p>

<p>With the words of this song we will close the history
of the life of Princess Elizabeth in the home of her
parents.</p>

<span class="subhead">Arrival in Roumania.</span></h2>

<div><img class="drop-cap h" src="images/cap_h.jpg" width="68" height="68" alt="H" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Hardly</span> three years had gone by since, in
May 1866, Prince Charles had undertaken
the government of Roumania. Germany
was then in a state of excitement, the relations
between Prussia and Austria being much strained.
Every day a declaration of war was imminent. Under
these circumstances the newly elected Prince of Roumania
could only proceed in disguise and incognito through the
territory of the enemy. No one on board the ship which
had brought him down the Danube could have guessed
that their fellow-traveller, a modest and reserved young
man, was the scion of the house of Hohenzollern who
had the courage to carry the great mission of his house
to the distant East. When the ship anchored at Turnu
Severin, the first town of Roumania, triumphal arches
were seen erected close to the banks of the river, men in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
gold-embroidered uniforms, troops drawn up on parade,
and a countless crowd of people. All were awaiting the
arrival of the ship in joyful expectation.</p>

<p>Prince Carol I. had been on board the ship. The
endless cheers, the rolling of drums and the braying of
trumpets, were in his honour, as he left the ship with his
two companions and landed on Roumanian soil for the
first time. It was a historical moment of great importance.
As a thank-offering for the brilliant reception
which he had received at Turnu Severin, and as a
memorial of that day, the Prince has built a church
there at his own expense.</p>

<p>Full of confidence in the future of Roumania, and
inspired by an earnest determination to exert a powerful
influence on the fortunes of the country committed to
his charge, Prince Carol made his solemn entry into
Bucharest on the 22nd of May 1866. After taking the
kingly oath to the constitution laid before him by the
chambers, the young Prince addressed the assembled
parliament in the following short but weighty speech:&mdash;“In
setting foot on the soil of this country I have
become a Roumanian. I know that great duties are
required of me, but I hope to fulfil them. I bring to
my new country a true heart, loyal intentions, a strong
determination to uphold the right, a boundless devotion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
and that unswerving respect for the law which I have
inherited from my ancestors. A citizen to-day, to-morrow,
if need be, a soldier, I shall share with you
from henceforth both good and evil days alike. Trust
me as I trust you. God only knows what the future has
in store for our country. In the meantime let us be
unweary in the fulfilment of our duties, and Providence,
which has guided your chosen sovereign thus far and
cleared all difficulties from my path, will surely not leave
her work unaccomplished.”</p>

<p>Extraordinary difficulties met him at once in the
beginning of his reign. Russia regarded him with an
unfriendly eye, Austria treated him as an enemy, and
Turkey found fault with all he did. Added to this the
lax discipline of the army, the untrustworthiness of the
officials, low finances, persecution of the Jews, and a
crisis in the ministry! The ruler of this land, thus
shattered by the strife of parties, had need of a firm will
and unshaken confidence in the success of his enterprise
if he would restore it to order. But Prince Charles had
undertaken the position with a true sense of his heavy
responsibilities. In a very short time he realised the
grave difficulties of the task. Every affair of State or
question of law, and even the practical affairs of the
country, were submitted to his careful judgment. Restlessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
active himself, he demanded much work and great
perseverance from his ministers. In order to understand
the wants of the people and the faults of the administration,
Prince Charles constantly travelled through the
length and breadth of his country. With a discerning
glance he sought to find those men from amongst his
subjects who combined a knowledge of the affairs of
their country with true patriotism. He could consequently
be assured of their help when he called them
to his side as councillors.</p>

<p>In order to unite Roumania with the rest of Europe
new roads of communication were opened, the teaching
in church and school improved, and the reforms in the
army begun on a large scale. Prince Charles steadily
pursued his plans of reform, though his endeavours
were misconstrued by those who wished him ill, and he
had often to face the greatest difficulties because many
of his ideas did not succeed at once. He well knew
that many years must go by before Roumania could
be radically improved, and that his reforms must be
progressive and slow. He awaited a time of lasting
success with the wisdom and perseverance of a true
statesman. He might well say: “I stand here alone
at this distant post as sentry facing the East. And
as a captain on a stormy sea must stand by his ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
by night and day, so must I keep watch and
ward.”</p>

<p>True to his oath, he identified himself with his people
from the moment that he undertook the government
of the Danubian principalities. He had done this
with a high sense of duty and the conscientiousness
of a true German.</p>

<p>At the side of this man of lofty character, who had
already made his mark in the world, Princess Elizabeth
was to enter her new home. On the 18th of November
the young princely pair had left Neuwied. They
stopped at Pesth in order to visit the Emperor of
Austria, and continued their journey on the 21st amid
the enthusiastic cheers of the Roumanians settled at
Pesth. A special train brought their Highnesses to
Bazias, where the Austrian steamer <i>Franz Josef</i> awaited
them. The banner of Roumania waved at the high mast,
the sailors manned the oars, and the <i>Franz Josef</i>
steamed between the craggy rocks of the Danube towards
Roumania.</p>

<p>Thus they reached Alt-Orsova. The Czerna, or
Black River, here joins its waves to those of the
Danube, and forms the boundary between Austria and
Roumania. The sentries of the frontier saluted, and
the inhabitants of the few slate-roofed houses shouted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
“Hurrah!” A rocky island, with a half ruined fortress
of New Orsova, stands further down the Danube. The
garrison presented arms, and three times the flag with
a half moon was lowered as a sign of greeting.
Opposite New Orsova lies Verzerova, the frontier town
of Roumania. The so-called “borderers” had arranged
themselves in a long line along the shore. They were
dressed in long grey cloaks, and wore sandals, whilst
their garments were fastened together with leathern
girdles and straps. On the column of Trajan the
Datians are represented in the same costume. The
rolling of drums, the braying of trumpets, and endless
cheers greeted the ship, which was then proceeding at
slow speed. The princely pair stood on deck and
greeted the boundary of their country and their first
subjects.</p>

<p>The Danube here winds its way through an immense
wilderness. High and almost perpendicular rocks enclose
the mighty bed of the river, which has many
windings, and becomes narrower as it proceeds. Hardly
has the <i>Franz Josef</i> passed the most dangerous of
the eddies when the “Iron Gateway” is reached. The
banks of the river are opener here, and not so much shut
in by the rocks, but the roaring of the foaming waves
tell of a dangerously rocky bed which here stretches to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
the whole breadth of the Danube for a long way. By
degrees the country becomes less desolate, the mountains
more distant. Rich fields and vineyards abound, and
stately groups of houses, with glistening church towers
rising above them, become visible.</p>

<p>It is Turnu Severin. The town, with its harbour,
looks very pretty as the ship approaches. The ships
that lie at anchor are bright with flags. Roumania’s
vessels of war, <i>Romania</i> and <i>Stephen Cel Mar</i>, are
among them. The steep banks of the river were
crowded with people. Endless cheers resounded as the
<i>Franz Josef</i> neared the land. The soldiers on board
the <i>Stephen Cel Mar</i> saluted, whilst the troops drawn
up on shore presented arms. Cannons roared, and
the solemn tones of the Roumanian National Hymn
were heard. On the 22nd of November (the birthday
of her lost brother) Princess Elizabeth, leaning on the
arm of her husband, first set foot on Roumanian soil.
She was received by well-dressed ladies carrying bouquets,
the Prime Minister, Prince Ghica, and the Prefect and
officials of the town. The national offering of bread
and salt was presented on a silver salver decorated with
flowers, and the keys of the town were presented to the
young Princess. Amidst the cheering of the people
and the tolling of bells the Prince and Princess drove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
to the church. Here a <i>Te Deum</i> was first sung, and
then priests and people on their knees invoked the
blessing of the Almighty on the sovereign pair.</p>

<p>According to an ancient custom of the Greek Church,
a book of the gospels and the cross richly ornamented
with jewels was brought to them to kiss after the
service. Then followed a great reception at the Town
Hall, at which the officials of neighbouring districts
appeared in their picturesque national costumes. After
this the princely pair returned to the ship, whilst the
enthusiastic people rushed after the carriage, which
was covered with flowers. Citizens and people waving
their caps in the air shouted “Hurrah!” and “Se
treasca marüle Cor!” (Long life to your Highnesses!)</p>

<p>After this the Roumanian steamers accompanied the
<i>Franz Josef</i>. Deputations waited at every village
they passed, and a reception was everywhere accorded
them. Sometimes their progress was hindered by a
thick fog. Then the <i>Romania</i> and the <i>Stephen Cel
Mar</i> neared the <i>Franz Josef</i>, and the bands they
had on board played lively airs till the rays of the sun
dispersed the mists and they could proceed on their
way. They reached Giurgevo, the capital of the district
Vlaska. Here the princely pair landed, greeted again by
the sound of the National Anthem and the enthusiastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
cheering of the crowd. Under a richly decorated
triumphal arch the officials of the district of Vlaska
did homage to the Princess, and the town of Giurgevo
besought her graciously to accept a cart of Roumanian
soil as her own. A carriage drawn by eight horses,
which were ridden by postillions in national costume,
here awaited their Highnesses. Peasants in their
richest dress rode on either side of the carriage. Each
one carried a fir-tree decorated with gilded apples and
glittering chains of gold tinsel. This is the emblem
of a Roumanian wedding which must never be wanting
at such ceremonies. According to Roumanian custom
the princely carriage with its picturesque suite was taken
at a gallop through the streets towards the station,
pursued by the crowd, who were cheering excitedly.
At the station there was another official reception, at
which the Pacha of Rustschuk had also appeared.</p>

<p>A special train was in readiness. It was the first
railway that had been built on Roumanian territory,
the first time that the Prince proceeded by rail from
Giurgevo to Bucharest. They were now travelling
through the great plain of Wallachia. The inhabitants
of the neighbourhood had assembled along the route
and at the stations to welcome the sovereign pair.</p>

<p>In an intense heat as of summer, at one o’clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
on the afternoon of the 25th of November, the train
neared the capital of Roumania. The station is built
upon a little height to the south of the town, from
whence there is a view over a landscape of oriental
beauty. Bucharest is spread over undulating valleys
on two sides of the Dimbovitza, and one looks down
upon a multitude of bright-coloured houses. The lead-covered
domes of the three hundred and sixty churches
shine among the groups of trees as if they were of
silver. Upon a hill in the centre of the town stands
the white Metropolia, which towers above all. On the
day of the public entry many bright flags waved from
its bright towers. Amidst the green gardens rise the
palaces of the “Boyards,” with their roofs of lead,
galleries, arched passages, staircases, and small columns,
a curious mixture of Byzantine style and Turkish form.
The more distant houses seem to disappear in a haze
of blue. The dark chain of the Carpathians arises in
the background, abruptly ending with the snow-capped
peaks of the Bucegi. Those who first look down upon
this oriental world must necessarily be struck by its
curious and fantastic appearance. Princess Elizabeth,
with her enthusiastic, artistic nature, “was quite enchanted
at the gorgeous colouring of the picture which
here met her view.”</p>

In the great hall of the station the infantry and
National Guard had been drawn up with their regimental
band and flags. All the Ministers and Prefects were
present at the reception. Cantacuzeno, the Mayor of
Bucharest, greeted their Highnesses in the name of the
town with the usual bread and salt. A deputation of
ladies of the aristocracy presented the Princess with a
nosegay in a golden handle studded with diamonds.
The representatives of the Guilds, with their emblems
and flags, as well as numerous bearers of fir-trees
glittering with gold, were waiting outside the station.
The military formed a line to the town. The multitudes
of Roumanians who, attired in their Sunday best,
crowded the streets, houses, and balconies, in order to
welcome the young Princess on her entry, were not to
be numbered.</p>

<p>Amidst the thundering of the cannons, the pealing of
the bells of all the churches, the strains of the National
Anthem, and whilst the troops were presenting arms,
and the crowds cheering enthusiastically, the procession,
which was opened by the bearers of the fir-trees, wound
its way up to the Metropolia. The clergy, assembled in
large numbers, received the princely pair at the door
of the church. At their head was the much-respected
Metropolitan of Bucharest, the Primate of Roumania.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
His garment of cloth of gold surrounded him in stiff
folds. Upon his head was a mitre glittering with
precious stones, and he bore the bishop’s staff, encircled
by a serpent, in his hand. The Metropolitan of Jassy
stood beside him, and in a large half circle round were
the bishops of the different dioceses&mdash;magnificent figures
with flowing beards and garments of gold brocade.
Further off many clergy of lower rank had been
placed.</p>

<p>Through a large entrance hall erected for this ceremony
their Highnesses entered the centre of the
church, under whose huge dome two magnificently
carved thrones had been prepared for them. The <i>Te
Deum</i> had been sung by the choir of priests, then
the Metropolitan read the Gospel for the day in solemn
tones, and in an unbroken stillness the congregation
listened to the words of Holy Writ.</p>

<p>A song of praise resounded once more, and then
Prince Charles descended the steps of the throne with
his bride, and proceeding to the high altar, knelt before
the Metropolitans, who offered them the Cross and the
Book of the Gospels to kiss. The high wax candles,
and the eternal lamps before the pictures of the saints,
could only shed a soft light through the immense
church. But the sun stole through the small stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
windows and magically lighted up this interesting and
pompous scene, during which the young German
princely pair was surrounded by the pomp and magnificence
of the oriental priesthood and initiated into its
mysteries.</p>

<p>The ceremony in the church was ended. Opposite to
the entrance to the church steps led up to a large
platform which had been erected. Two thrones were
placed there under a rich daïs of purple. Forty young
couples had received their marriage outfit from Prince
Charles in honour of the occasion, and were to be
married on that day. In the Green Hall, on both sides
of the way that their Highnesses must pass, stood the
brown-eyed maidens in bridal array, their masses of
black hair covered with hanging golden threads, which
are the badge of the Wallachian bride. The princely
pair were conducted to their thrones by a long procession
formed by the clergy, the ministers and ladies in
waiting, cavaliers, senators, deputations, the diplomatic
corps, &amp;c. Here the marriage contract was brought to
them on a red velvet cushion, and was confirmed by
their signature. In a clear voice, which could be heard
at a distance, Prince Charles then made a short speech
to his subjects, after which the pealing of bells and the
thunder of cannon announced to the Roumanian people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
that the Mayor of Bucharest had inscribed the marriage
in the registers of the town.</p>

<p>Martial music now resounded, and a procession of
carriages was arranged, which moved slowly towards
the castle amidst the joyous cheers of the crowd. Of
endless variety were the types of the assembled multitude.
The national costumes, which the people of
Roumania have preserved intact, were gorgeous in
colour and brilliancy. The fine type of the women, with
their glittering bodices, their wulinks or aprons adorned
with bright embroidery and little plates of metal, their
veils and sandals, made up a fine picture. Then the
men with their round fur caps over their black eyes,
their bronzed faces surrounded with dark curls, a jacket
of sheep’s skin embroidered with flowers and geometrical
figures over their shoulders, and a long garment beneath,
the adornment of which was primitive. Amongst these
picturesque groups were Wallachian Jews in furs, and
beggars in rags and tatters.</p>

<p>All these made up a peculiarly picturesque scene, and
all eyes were riveted on the graceful presence of their
young Princess.</p>

<p>In the throne room of the palace a deputation of
the ladies of Bucharest presented the Princess with an
offering from the town. It consisted of a costly diadem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
of pearls and diamonds, and a beautifully and artistically
embroidered national costume. This was the close
of the official reception.</p>

<p>When the twilight was fading into darkness the
houses of Bucharest were illuminated with many
colours. There was a gala representation at the theatre.
Allegoric groups with reference to the princely pair
were arranged on the stage, and an “Oda da Elisabeta”
had been composed for the occasion. So ended this
festive day, which had been enhanced by the most
beautiful weather, and during which everything had
gone off to perfection.</p>

<p>When Princess Elizabeth was leaving her old home
they had called after her&mdash;“May your entrance into
Roumania also be an entrance into the hearts of your
people.” This prophetic hope has been amply fulfilled.
By her simplicity and her amiable manners, as well
as by her winning voice and charming appearance,
Princess Elizabeth took all hearts by storm on her
arrival in Roumania. The expectant people felt at once
that this was a Princess who could understand and
relieve their distress. And they were not mistaken
in their judgment, for Princess Elizabeth has become a
mother to her country in the fullest sense of the word.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> Princess had begun her new life in her
new home with illness. Only her wonderful
energy had enabled her to bear the
fatigues of her public reception whilst
labouring under great physical discomfort. On the
third day after her public entrance the Princess was
attacked by the measles, though fortunately only slightly,
and the illness was not of long duration. After the
great excitement of the last weeks the enforced quiet
could only be desirable. How happy the Princess felt
in her new surroundings a little poem shows which
she inscribed in her Journal on the 12th of December
1869:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“From a gladsome month a jubilee song<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Soars up to the skies above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the lark’s song saying, so clear and strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">‘What a beautiful world to love!’”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>
<p>After her recovery the first expedition the Princess
made was to Cotroceni, which is situated on a height
at ten minutes’ distance from Bucharest. It is an old
monastery, surrounded by a thickly wooded park, which
the Prince had arranged as a country house for the
summer. Not far off, beyond the green trees, the
shining domes of the Asyle Hélène, an educational
establishment for young orphan girls, are seen. From
this height the view of Bucharest is also very fine.
This is nearer to the town than the station, and the
coming and going in the wood-paved streets can be
distinctly perceived. Women in their dazzlingly white
linen and embroidered garments are seen busily painting
their cottages white and their windows red and blue.
These cottages are roofed with wooden tiles, and lie
scattered between the gorgeous palaces of the Boyards.
Under the willows and alders on the banks of the
Dimbovitza lie magnificent buffaloes, idly resting, and
half lost to view in the deep mud and the green foliage.
Only their expressive faces with their immense horns
are still visible. Carriages drawn by eight and sometimes
twelve little horses rush by at full gallop. A
boy guides them with one hand. His fiery glances and
his fur cap placed on one side of his head lead one to
gather that he is not of a sort to stop at any danger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
Carmen Sylva has drawn a lively picture of these
characteristics of the Roumanian coachman in her poem
called “The Post.” Here artistic ideas meet one at
every turn, for amidst such surroundings everything
groups itself into a picture, especially during the
oriental sunsets, the glowing colours of which blend
harmoniously.</p>

<p>Now the life of duty which her exalted station imposed
upon her began for the Princess&mdash;“It is only in
Roumania that something remains to be done,” she had
exclaimed in fun. And now she stood face to face with
her coveted sphere. A large field of labour, till now
uncultivated, lay before her. The first thing was to
become acquainted with the soil and its resources. In
this the large Court receptions could not help her. Consequently
Princess Elizabeth had arranged that each lady
who wished to pay her respects at Court was to be
separately received by her. Being exceptionally free
from prejudice, she now learnt to understand the true
worth of people, and to realise what they thought and
felt. “It was too disagreeable to me,” she said, “to
have to say things during the State receptions which I
did not really mean. In order not to be false, I endeavoured
to feel the interest which I expressed. Every
human being is in want of sympathy. And now every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
one interests me, and I find them all interesting. Consequently
I do not now find the audiences tiresome;
on the contrary, I look forward to them. The smallest
thing I do must be done with my whole heart if it is to
succeed, and the least thing I am will require all my
power if I am to be anything.”</p>

<p>The beginning of the year 1870 brought with it many
tears. There were many conflicts and confusions in the
Administration. The Franco-German War having been
declared, her brother, Prince William of Wied, had
responded to the call of his country, and received an
officer’s commission in the general staff of the army corps.
His mother, his bride, and his sister trembled for his life.
But he passed through the field of battle unscathed, and
was decorated with the iron cross as a reward of his
valour. On the 7th of September Princess Elizabeth received
a letter from Prince William, written from Sedan,
with the news of victory. At noon on the following day,
the 8th of September, twenty-one salvos of artillery announced
to the inhabitants of Bucharest that a daughter
was born to their princely house. A few hours later
the Metropolitan appeared in full dress. He held the
sacred Ikon over the mother and the child in its cradle,
blessed them with holy water, and repeated the customary
prayers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
The new-born Princess was baptized into the orthodox
Greek Church, and received the name of “Marie.” The
news of the event was received with great joy through
the country&mdash;“God bless the new citizen of Roumania,
and may she grow up to be the joy of her parents and a
blessing to her country.” This was the devout wish of
many thousands of people. The tiny Princess became
forthwith almost the most important personage in the
whole of Roumania. Every one was interested in her
welfare, and she seemed to belong to all, for she was
born in the country.</p>

<p>Princess Elizabeth was intensely devoted to her beloved
child. She was filled with the sacred feeling of happy
motherhood. The radiant eyes of her child changed
the face of the world to her. She had a still deeper
sympathy for the sorrows of others, and their happiness
became but a reflection of her own. As a recollection
of this time she wrote in her Journal at a later date the
following poem, entitled</p>

<p class="title">MOTHER.</p>

</div>

<p>But whilst this treasure of the princely house
flourished and grew in its nurseries, there was much
trouble in the country. The Strousberg railway affairs
became a great difficulty to the Prince. He employed
every means in his power to arrange the matter according
to the best interests of Roumania. A crisis in the
ministry necessitated a change of Cabinet. A revolution
broke out in Bucharest. The Prince would have
resigned, but his steadfast calmness impressed the passionate
and excitable people of Roumania; the stormy
political waves were gradually subdued, and the work for
the country proceeded quietly once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Meanwhile Princess Elizabeth diligently studied the
Roumanian language. Her knowledge of Latin and
Italian were a good foundation for the idiom of the
country, and she soon overcame all difficulties. She is
now entirely mistress of the Roumanian language, and
the Roumanians proudly declare that their Queen speaks
it better than themselves, as she forms her sentences
with peculiar exactness. In the year 1871 the first
society for the relief of the poor was founded by
Princess Elizabeth, and soon after a society for the
translation of children’s books. “There are absolutely
no Roumanian books for the schools and the people,”
Princess Elizabeth wrote to her mother. “I will undertake
this. I have already divided my best French
children’s books amongst the young ladies, and have
gained the interest of some gentlemen. The poet
Alexandri will criticise and correct the translations,
which are then to be quickly and cheaply printed. In
this manner the language itself will become more fixed,
and the young people, who do not speak their own
language correctly, will learn it to perfection. It is
curious how zealously the people take up this idea.
They regard it as a safeguard against the revolutionary
ideas of the young people, who now discuss nothing but
politics. Politics excite the people here to such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
extent that men, women, and even children have no
other interests. General Florescu is the most eager in
furthering my plans, and thinks that if I interest more
people in this movement it would have a good influence
on society. Private theatricals and concerts also awake
more noble ambitions. Societies for relieving the poor,
for translating and teaching, everything is arranging
itself by degrees.”</p>

<p>In April 1871 the Prince travelled with his consort
through Moldavia to Jassy, that she might also learn to
know this part of her country. The journey resembled
a triumphal procession, and their reception was brilliant
and hearty everywhere. At all the greater places deputations
and petitions were received, the customary bread
and salt presented, and a <i>Te Deum</i> heard in the church.
The Princess writes&mdash;“It is impossible to imagine such
enthusiasm and the cheers given by thousands. Our
time in Jassy was filled up with audiences, visits to
churches and schools, expeditions to the neighbouring
monasteries, &amp;c. Joyful enthusiasm prevailed among
all the people.”</p>

<p>On her return the Princess wrote to her mother&mdash;“How
shall I describe to you the magnificent country
through which we drove, our eight horses with postillions
cracking their whips and shouting, the three or four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
hundred peasants who accompanied <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ventre à terra</i>, their
mantles of white goat’s hair streaming in the wind, and
their high, white fur caps on their heads! What shall
I say about the nice people in Moldavia, and of the
proud feeling it was to hear on every railway line, on
every bridge and highroad, that my husband had had it
made, and then to gallop onward! And then returning
here, after thousands had greeted us, again to clasp the
best beloved amongst all those thousands, healthy and
blooming, in my arms!” Does not untold happiness
resound in these words? And now the Princess of
Wied was soon expected, a pleasure which Princess
Elizabeth and her husband were eagerly looking forward
to. In July 1871 the wedding of Prince William of
Wied had been celebrated at the Hague. A few weeks
later the Princess of Wied first visited her children at
Bucharest, and held her first grandchild in her arms.
Bright happiness filled their hearts and their home.</p>

<p>For the health of the little Princess it became desirable
to spend the summer with her in mountain and
forest air. It is the only remedy against the attacks
of fever to which every one is subjected soon or later in
the Roumanian plains. From this time the Prince resided
in the Carpathians in the summer. There in the
valley of the Prahova, two thousand nine hundred feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
high, upon a precipitous rocky mountain, stands the
monastery of Sinaia. A Prince Cantacuzéne had built
and named it after the Temple on Mount Sinai. It had
been used till then as a Hospice for the many caravans
of ox-carts which, laden with maize, proceed day and
night almost uninterruptedly over the mountain paths
to Transylvania. The peaks of the Carpathians tower
in fantastic forms behind the monastery. Carmen
Sylva has enriched them with poetic legends in her
poems. First comes Virful-cu-Dor (the Heights of
Longing), then Furnica, Piatre Arsa, the two Jipi
which arise like the teeth of a giant. The deafening
waterfall Urlatoare (the Howling One) rushes down to
the Prahova valley, and the Omul and Caraiman, eight
thousand nine hundred feet in height, stand dark and
threatening with their mighty rocks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 371px;">
<img src="images/illus_003.jpg" width="371" height="586" alt="" />
<div class="captionr"><i>Woodbury Compy.</i></div>

<div class="caption">
<p>CASTLE PELESCH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>These are all names which we have learnt to know
and love through the “little book” from Carmen Sylva’s
“Kingdom.” Huge mountains crowned with verdure
stretch into the plain. Their feet are clothed with
forests of beech and oak, whilst their heights are covered
with fir-trees. From the monastery you attain the deep
solitude of a forest which is here as beautiful as a dream.
Gigantic old trees rear their branches to heaven. If one
falls, oppressed with the weight of years, it is allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
to remain there till, covered with creepers and moss, it
completes the woodland scenery, and young trees grow
out of the mouldering trunk. Ferns and orchids of
endless varieties and unusual height delight the friend
of nature. In this magnificent vegetation every foot of
land is covered with multitudes of botanic species, one
might say the history of the forest. The most beautiful
flowers of the Alps, Edelweiss and Almenrausch,
are found on the heights of the foremost mountains.
Not far from the monastery the Pelesch casts itself down
from Bucegi to the valley below in a foaming waterfall,
“wildly escaping from its bounds as if it would take
the world by storm.” Its seething waves flow down
endlessly, and the river winds hither and thither, and
has often devastated the country in its course. It is
a beautiful and ever varying picture of steep mountains,
shady valleys, and running brooks.</p>

<p>The white walls of the monastery welcome the wanderer
from afar. The one-storied building is of very humble
dimensions, and surrounds the square court of the
monastery, which is devoid of any ornament, and in the
centre of which a church stands. The inhabited part
is ornamented with wooden arcades, and old Byzantine
paintings still adorn the outside walls. Thirty monks,
types of the eastern clergy, here enjoy in peaceful repose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
the blessings of this pious institution. Half of this
humble habitation had been allotted to the Prince.
Lightly built additions in fir wood had been made to
the principal building in order to make it at all habitable.
If the banner of Roumania had not waved over
the entrance, and sentries paced up and down the
verandahs, one could easier imagine that an artist had
made his home here than that this was the residence of
a Prince. We can scarcely conceive with what simplicity
and content the princely pair here bore the
greatest discomfort for many years. The Princess, for
instance, heard the ticking of the clock in the neighbouring
cell of an old monk in her dressing-room. The
monks dined in the refectory; the Prince in a passage
which had been arranged as a dining-room. At first
provisions arrived from Kronstadt only twice in the
week. But no deprivations seemed worth mentioning
here, for in Sinaia as in Monrepos was forest air and
liberty in which the Princess delighted.</p>

<p>Higher up in the valley, under the shade of high
trees, the Prince had built a shooting-box, and surrounded
it with a simple garden. Under its roof the Princess
arranged a tiny room very artistically. One gazes
through coloured windows upon the groups of fir trees
of a hundred years’ growth. A simple desk covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
with cloth, a pair of chairs, and a low table laden with
books, paint brushes, and colours are all its furniture.
It is the sanctum of the Princess, to which she retires
when the stream of visitors who unceasingly come out
to Sinaia have fatigued her. Here she can write,
paint, and compose poetry undisturbed.</p>

<p>Scientific men, musicians, and painters are constantly
invited to Sinaia, and are often for weeks the guests
of the princely pair. Here they lead an ideal life.
Intercourse with distinguished people, be they artists or
learned or otherwise clever men, is the great delight
of the Prince and Princess. They love to gaze, as it
were, into the workshop whence thought has sprung,
and have a deep regard for the earnestness of labour
in art or science. Gaiety and cheerfulness reign in
these circles. Often the Princess will read to the
assembled company at breakfast a poem she has just
completed, that treats of their conversations or the
events of the day, with youthful cheerfulness. By noon
the winged words have already been set to music by
one of the musicians, and presented to the Princess
as a duet, trio, or quartette, according to the voices of
those present. In the evening these new compositions
are performed, and the young people end the day with
dances and games.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
Long walks and climbing parties are undertaken
during the fine weather. Accompanied by the sound
of the waves of the restless Pelesch, one climbs along
grassy walks into the steep beech woods. In a convenient
costume for mountaineering, the Princess, hat
in hand, leads the way for the joyous company. She
feels at home in the woods or in the mountains: they
are her kingdom, and there her fancy is free. The
following poem was composed on the 12th of September
1873, under the trees near the shooting-box:&mdash;</p>

<p>Here in Sinaia Princess Elizabeth came into direct
communication with the people, winning hearts and
showering blessings everywhere. In order to encourage
native industry she made up her mind to wear the
Roumanian national costume during their summer
residence in the Carpathians. All the ladies of the
Court soon followed her example, and carried out the
wish of their sovereign. One could imagine oneself
transported into the middle of a fairy tale whilst a troop
of lovely ladies, in glittering garments which glow with
bright colours, suddenly appear on a hill-side or beside
a mountain stream under mighty beech and fir-trees.
There are dainty embroideries in gold and silver, golden
head-dresses and long flowing veils which are picturesquely
bound round the head and neck. The whole
of this oriental costume has its charms enhanced by
the lively southern temperament of the Roumanian
ladies.</p>

<p>Princess Elizabeth has a motherly love and care for
her ladies of honour, and leads quite a patriarchal family
life with them. She is particularly fond of surrounding
herself with young people. Young girls are constantly
invited to spend some weeks at Sinaia, where they are
allowed to share the laborious life of their mistress, who
cannot bear to see any one sitting idle near her. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
one around the Princess must be in a state of constant
activity. The pet name of “Whirlwind,” given to her
in fun in her childhood, was also applied to her later by
a relation. The Princess and her ladies write and read,
make music, write poetry, work and paint together. She
endeavours to awaken a love of nature in the minds of
the young, and to enliven their walks with interesting
conversations. The Princess is constant in her endeavours
to awaken intellectual interests in her people, and
hopes by this serious foundation to overcome the frivolous
tone of society, and to train the mothers of the coming
generation to a more ideal life. It is a lovely sight to
see the Princess, in the becoming dress of the country,
sitting under the trees with a circle of young girls around
her, some of whom are closely pressed to her. The
Princess either reads to them or discusses a charitable
institution for the country, and sometimes a plan for a
future poem. Then one sees beautiful brown eyes looking
up at “Dòamna Elisabeta” with love and admiration.
All freely express their thoughts and feelings. The
Princess has been compared to the women of the Middle
Ages, and called “Anne de Bretagne.” She is indeed
a bright example of deep culture and feminine virtues
to all women.</p>

<p>The little Princess Marie flourished and grew in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
happy circle, and was a charming and peculiarly thoughtful
child, as her mother had been. She was, as she is
described in Carmen Sylva’s fairy tale, a “sunny child,
full of grace and charm.” Happiness and love had been
given to her as companions and playfellows. Joy and
bliss, which no pen could describe or brush depict, then
rained upon her. It was an endless May-day. “The
mother watched her daughter’s happy games from a
distance, and blessed the earth upon which her child was
so radiantly happy.”</p>

<p>The happy time spent amid the solitudes of woods and
mountains and in that fine air passed only too quickly.
Life in the capital, with its many claims, had to be taken
up again, but happiness remained. This feeling is
expressed in the month of January 1872, in which the
Princess writes to her mother:&mdash;“They talk of a costume
ball: it amuses me immensely, for I have never seen anything
of the sort, and think it must be like a charming
fairy tale. We insist upon being young again, and
having childish amusements! I am particularly pleased
to be able to show that I am no Puritan, and can discuss
‘Chiffons,’ when something pretty is to be arranged.
A great many people come to me for advice, as they
know that Charles has treasures in the shape of old
books and engravings. My quiet reading in the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
consoles me for the cutting up of the day. So I do not
give my time to my correspondence, as I must prepare
myself in order to help others with good advice, bad
Roumanian, studies of costumes, and conversation.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile much illness and constant fever had by
degrees so weakened the Princess that a change of air
became necessary. In the middle of March she had to
start alone for Italy without her husband or child, and
attended only by her suite. In Rome she was to meet
some relations. Thousands had called after her “Intorceti
sanatose” (Return in good health) when she left her
country. In May the Princess returned, blooming in
recovered health. The Prince had travelled to meet
her, and welcomed her on the Danube. “That was a
romantic meeting,” she writes. “I was on the <i>Stephen</i>,
Charles on the <i>Romania</i>, gay with flags and pennons.
We flew towards one another in brilliant sunshine. Both
of us were standing on deck watching to see when the
other eagerly expected ship should appear. I saw the
child two days later in Comana; she is indeed charming.
You cannot imagine what a sweet and affectionate little
being she is. If she embraces any one she says at once,
‘Make all happy,’ and kisses all present. She is easy
to educate, for she is so unhappy when she has done
something silly that one has to comfort her. As soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
as her heart is appealed to, all obstinacy and contrariness
disappear. She is also such a sensible and patient
child, and her blue eyes have such a deep gaze. What
thoughts dwell behind that high forehead, I wonder,
which looks so promising? I think that the love and
joy of a mother will remain the same as long as the
world stands, and make up to one for all the trials and
troubles of life. But earthly happiness must be very
delicately handled: it is very easily shattered.”</p>

<p>The Princess of Wied no longer lived at Monrepos
with Fräulein Lavater. The Prince of Wied and his
bride had made their home there. Only ten minutes’
distance from there, and nearly on the same height, the
Princess had had a house built for herself. It is
surrounded by woods, and has a beautiful view on the
Rhine, the mountains, towns, and villages. After the
village of Segendorf, which lies at the foot of the hill,
the house of the Princess was called Segen House. By
means of the silent, all-pervading spirit of love that
reigns there, and the loving and active sympathy of
the Princess for all suffering and those who were in
need of help, the house soon became a real “Segenhaus”
(House of blessing) to all who cross its hospitable
threshold. The current of intellectual life has also
accompanied the Princess of Wied to her new home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
In the summer of 1873 Princess Elizabeth travelled
thither with her little daughter. It was the first time
since her marriage that she had seen her German home.
The happiness of those weeks which she spent with
her mother, her brother and sister-in-law, and the dear
old friends in town and country, was unclouded.
“Monrepos! Monrepos! the laughing, rustling, and
sweet-scenting forest welcomes me, and happy faces
peer at me through it. Yes, Monrepos was my
Paradise!” She seemed to live through her childhood
and youth again with their deep joys and sorrows,
inward struggles and ultimate peace. Yes, happiness is
not to be found in an eternally blue sky, but in infinitesimally
small things out of which we shape our life
ourselves.</p>

<p>With justified maternal pride the mother could gaze
on her fair-haired and only little daughter, who became
again here the centre of all love and care. On the
journey between Mayence and Neuwied the child had
repeatedly asked, “Is that mamma’s Rhine?” But
the little Princess Marie had, notwithstanding her tender
age, an irresistible longing for the country in which she
had first seen the light. She was constantly craving to
be back again in her distant home, and became nearly
ill from home sickness. During the whole journey
she kept repeating&mdash;“Home, home, let us go home!”
When the Roumanian students came to meet them at the
station at Vienna, she called out to them in Roumanian,
“I am going home to Bucharest with eight horses.”</p>

<p>On the return of the Princess to Roumania, they once
more took up their abode in the romantic old monastery
of Sinaia. Typhus and scarlet fever were raging
in Bucharest. The Princess writes full of anxiety&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>“Bucharest
is in such an unhealthy state that I shall
return to it with fear and trembling. Typhus fever and
angina reign there supreme. Diphtheria has carried off
many of the children. They die in a few hours. I
often become as unsettled and melancholy as a dark day
in the autumn. Then an interesting person or piece of
news comes in, and one brightens up like the dew in
the sunshine.”</p>

<p>“<i>22nd November.</i>&mdash;It is four years to-day since I
arrived in Turnu Severin. Now I see the world here
in a different light. The tranquillity which habit brings
has come over me, instead of all my fear and trembling.
And I feel safer here, and more in my right place, than
anywhere else in the world.”</p>

<p class="title"><i>To her Brother.</i></p>

<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">Bucharest, 1873.</span>
</p>

<p>“People now often come to me to discuss their own
affairs and seek for advice, comfort, and help. This
makes me very happy, and as I wrote to some one lately:
I am beginning to grow to my ideal, which is to become
the confidential adviser of the Roumanian State, house,
and family. This is a very grateful office, and only in
this manner can I become really happy in my intercourse
with so many people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
“Yes, my life here is very rich and full. I could
not have imagined or wished it otherwise! It had to
be attained by great sacrifices, and my endeavour is to
make it worthy of them.”</p>

<p>“<i>24th November 1873.</i>&mdash;Itty now begins to say
such pretty little things. Seeing the bust of her
father lately, she exclaimed&mdash;‘Oh, look how Jack Frost
has fallen on papa.’ She has made great progress in
Roumanian this autumn, and sings three Roumanian
songs, also a German ditty. All the games of the
Kindergarten go very well already.”</p>

<p>“<i>24th March 1874.</i>&mdash;Itty has not forgotten any
part of her stay in ‘Segenhaus’&mdash;no place and no
name; and likes to talk of it all. She is a little Will-o’-the-Wisp,
in all corners at once, which is a great trial
for Mentor, the favourite dog. She makes him nervous,
and he struggles to free himself from her embraces. He
is not demonstrative, and likes to be left in peace. It
is too funny to see them!”</p>

<p>“<i>February 1874.</i>&mdash;Diphtheria and scarlet fever are
raging in Bucharest. A great many children die.
When we mothers meet we ask each other, ‘Are your
children still well?’”</p>

<p>The little Princess also had a slight attack of diphtheria,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
which was soon overcome by speedy remedies. In the
course of the winter she asked her mother&mdash;“Will the
frost come down from the little stars where God lives
and make Itty cold?” On Palm Sunday, the 5th of
April, she was seized with scarlet fever of very serious
symptoms. Diphtheria was soon added to it, and the
danger increased every hour. It was impossible to
persuade the child to allow herself to be put into her
crib. “Oh! no, no!” she sobbed; “if I lie down, I
shall go to sleep and never wake again.” During the
night of Maunday Thursday, whilst burning with fever,
the sweet child repeatedly called out&mdash;“I will drive to
Sinaia and drink of the water of the Pelesch.” When
a cooling drink was offered to her she shook her little
head and said&mdash;“All is finished!” It was on Maunday
Thursday, the 9th of April; the child lay on the lap
of its English nurse. Her mother knelt before her,
holding her little hands. After violent attacks of
suffocation, she breathed once more&mdash;then a great silence
followed&mdash;no breath stirred again.</p>

<p>Till the last moment the Princess had not realised
that the bright life of her child was nearing its close.
But when all was still, and she grasped the dreadful
certainty, she bent with humble resignation before the
holy will of God. She herself closed the loved blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
eyes of her precious child, then rose quite calm and
collected, and thanked the doctors for their faithful care.
No words of complaint passed her lips! Her strength
remained firm till they placed the body of the child in
its little bed.</p>

<p>The tender care of the Prince for his beloved wife
was very touching. He was utterly prostrated by the
unexpected blow, and earnestly sought for comfort and
composure. “God loved my child more than ever I did,
and so He has taken it to Himself!” exclaimed the poor
mother with wonderful calmness. When the little body
was placed in the coffin, and it had been closed over
her, the Princess put her hand on it and spoke as in
prayer&mdash;“God bless my child.” The Prince himself
helped to bear the coffin to the staircase of the palace.
A troop of young girls from the Asyle Hélène opened
the procession, singing the funeral hymn with hushed
voices. In their white dresses, long white veils, and
wreaths of white flowers, they seemed spirits of light
preceding the sunny child to its last resting-place. Not
four years had passed since the little Princess had been
baptized in the Church of Cotroceni, and now the little
coffin stood on the same place covered with flowers.
Multitudes of people from the town and the country
joined the procession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Upon the slope of a hill between the Asyle Hélène
and the park of Cotroceni lies the little grave, hidden in
a wood, near the Church of Elisabeta Dòamna. A low
mound with a simple stone marks the place where the
princely pair had laid to rest their little daughter who
was so passionately loved! On the stone is engraved
the consoling words of St. Luke viii. 53: “<span class="smcap">Weep not,
for she is not dead, but sleepeth.</span>” Trees, firs and
pines, as well as all sorts of roses and flowers, surround
this little sanctum, which is entrusted to the care and
protection of the orphan child of the Asyle Hélène.
Beside it stands the simple seat as a resting-place.</p>

<p>The sorrow of the parents for the loss of their only
child can never be lightened, and will only end with
their last breath. But the hope of a heavenly life beyond
the grave is the comfort of these bereaved ones!</p>

<p>For many months hundreds of people made pilgrimages
to this spot, for the whole country mourned with
the afflicted parents. During her short life the little
Princess Marie had become the idol of the people, and
the Roumanians had looked up to her with pride as
being their own possession! All who were allowed to
approach the bereaved parents during this time of bitter
sorrow were much impressed by their unselfish resignation
to the mysterious will of God. When the Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
was given to understand this, she answered&mdash;“Dites
à leur tous, que je tâche de suivre l’example de ma
mère. Je l’ai vue souffrir! Elle était plus forte que
moi!”</p>

<p>On the 12th of April 1874, after the death of her
child, Princess Elizabeth wrote to her mother:&mdash;“God
has drawn my child to Himself in His love! May He
eternally be praised for the great happiness which was
mine! I would rather become a weeping rock like
Niobe than never have been a mother! Yes, it is too
much joy for one little human heart! My child is so
happy, my love is stronger than the grave, and I can
rejoice in its joy! There is so much to say about the
little one, because she already had such marked characteristics,
and was so independent, original, and charming.
Still she is mine for all eternity! I have not
lost the high dignity of a mother because my child is
separated from me. The great happiness which I enjoy
is not too dearly bought with this great sorrow! The
pain is a thousand times outweighed by the joy, for it
was joy without a pang, and now it is joyful pain!</p>

I feel that after such great blessings I have no right

<p>“The people here regard it as a great happiness to
die on Thursday in holy week, for on that day, they
say, Heaven is open, and one flies in. Consequently
they regard me as a happy mother, to whom God has
granted that for which they ever pray, which is that
if He sees fit to take a child, it may die on this
Thursday. What a curious coincidence! Even this
brings us nearer to the people, for they regard us as
so richly blessed. The whole country shows us the
greatest sympathy. Our little grave is always covered
with wreaths and flowers which are placed there by
unknown hands. The girls from the Asyle come singly
to the grave in the early morning, say their prayer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
bring a little flower, and see that the lamp is still
burning. It is a great help to me that I came into

dead. Consequently that which lies nearest my heart

<p>Shortly before the child had been taken ill, the Princess
had suffered much from her eyes, and could now hardly
occupy herself at all. It was a great affliction to her
to whom work was life! During these sad, dark days
she framed the sweet expressions of her child in verses

<span class="i0">How often, my child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In those halcyon days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou lain, and smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kissing the rays.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Didst draw them to thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thy fingers in sport,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or came they unsought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy playmates to be?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ne’er could divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But methinks at thy birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wast sent on a sunbeam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me and the earth.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>And now the sunbeams have kissed the lovely child
and taken her away with them. It seems as if all earthly
hopes and all earthly joy had been buried with her.
A deep sorrow and an unutterable longing stole into
the heart of the Princess, which only a mother can
really understand, and which can only end with life.

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">“In</span> work, in constant and unwearied labour,
we must look for comfort in sorrow,” says
Carmen Sylva, in her tale, “The Pilgrimage
of Sorrow.” This has been truly carried
out in her life. Whilst composing those sorrowful
poems in which her unutterable longing for her lost child
is expressed in such touching words, the Princess could
become quite cheerful for a few moments in the recollection
of her lost happiness as a mother. But her health
had suffered much from all she had gone through. The
doctors urged a water cure in Franzensbad. Prince
Charles escorted his consort thither in the summer of
1874. In Franzensbad her pen became more than ever
her best friend, and her intellectual labours brought her
comfort and strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
At first no one in Roumania guessed that Princess
Elizabeth was a poetess. When the Roumanian poet
Alexandri once waited upon her at Bucharest, the
Princess said, whilst blushing deeply&mdash;“I should like to
make a confession to you, but I have not the courage.”
After much hesitation the Princess whispered shyly&mdash;“I
also write poetry.” At Alexandri’s request she let him
see some of her poems. He recognised her poetic talent
at once, and encouraged her to go on with what was but
a reflection of her thoughts and feelings. When a time
of deep sorrow came to the Princess, Alexandri wrote
many poems for her. He then sent her a thick volume
of his poems to Franzensbad, and she began to translate
the legends of the people of Roumania into German.
“In Franzensbad,” writes the Princess, “the greatest
change took place in my powers of writing poetry. Till
then I had not known that poetry was an art, or that it
could be learnt, if one were not a poet by nature. To
learn to make verses seemed to me as if one would teach
a bird to sing. Verses and rhymes flowed more easily
from my pen than prose. I was afraid that if I were to
bind myself to rules and regulations I should forfeit the
power of writing verse as a punishment for my arrogance
and conceit. But in the unutterable woe of the spring
of 1874 writing poetry brought me no relief. Only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
consecutive hard work could soothe me. And so I took
to translating. Alexandri’s ‘Rows of Pearls’ attracted
me the most, because Kotzebue in his translation had
completely changed the metre and altered much. Then
I suddenly realised that I did not understand the very
elements of the art of poetry. I was hampered for
words and rhymes. This had never happened to me,
and my work was very unsatisfactory. I wanted to ask
a hundred questions at every word, and did not know
of whom.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Wilhelm von Kotzebue also came to
Franzensbad. He had long held a diplomatic post in
Moldavia, and was well known to the literary world as
a writer. He had also translated the national songs
which Alexandri had collected into German. The
Princess now discussed her translations with him.
Kotzebue, an earnest and noble man, showed and explained
to the Princess her faults in the construction of
her verses. Now she had to work by rule and submit
to certain laws&mdash;“But in that hour in which a man like
Kotzebue thought it worth his while to criticise my
work, I began to believe in my talent.” “I did not
venture,” said the Princess, “to show him an original
poem, but only my first translations of Roumanian
poetry. They were very full of faults and clumsy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
because I knew nothing of the science of poetry then,
though I was thirty years old. I altered the ‘Rows
of Pearls’ four times, and once more before it was
printed. I never learnt so much as whilst I was translating.
Even for many years after this I regarded
my talent as a misfortune, for I thought it was not
suited for my vocation. Like a child stealing sweetmeats,
I always threw away my pen when some one
came into my room.”</p>

<p>“Is it not wonderful?” the Princess writes to her
mother. “If heaven takes my loved ones from me with
one hand, it sheds the noblest and highest treasures
upon me with the other, and in what more loving and
attractive manner could I serve my country than in now
translating the literary treasures of my German Fatherland
into Roumanian! When I am not asleep my
hands and my head do not rest for a moment, for I
break down utterly otherwise. But constant activity
keeps my mind fresh, and it is only at times that some
sweet recollection overpowers me.</p>

<p>A great longing to see her beloved mother again took
possession of the Princess. The Princess of Wied had
been prevented by illness from being with her daughter
during her time of deepest sorrow. When they had last
met, the happy childish voice of the little Princess Marie
had been heard above the others. Now they could only
meet in sobs and tears! The princely pair were to
join the Princess of Wied at Cologne, and then to remain
some weeks with her at St. Leonard’s on the English
coast.</p>

<p>The Princess writes to the Princess of Wied from
Franzensbad on the 19th of July:&mdash;“It is good to fill
one’s mind with great impressions. One returns full of
thought. I am looking forward to England like a child.
I know what it will be to sit on the shore with you and
listen to the sound of the waves. To see London is
also a great attraction.”</p>

<p>“Looking back on this time,” the Princess writes,
“it was a great refreshment to disappear in that vast
London. We had never seen Max Müller till then, but
had been often in communication with him, and we
telegraphed to him that we were coming to Oxford.
He received us at the station, and invited us to stay at
his house. The two days spent in the peaceful atmosphere
of his home, in that charming family circle which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
had not then been broken, soothed and cheered me.
This happiness could not weigh upon the unhappy; it
could but do one good and allay the storm. It was the
happiness of a wise man. We also made the acquaintance
of Jane Stanley. I had then finished a little book
in the form of a missal for my mother, which I called
‘My Journey through the World’&mdash;all sorts of verses
and rhymes, dedicated to my mother. Charles Kingsley
was present when I surprised my mother with this
present. I showed him the <span class="locked">poem&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="title">MY ONLY ONE.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“O let no evil betide her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sin her pure heart enthrall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My God, with Thine own hand guide her&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou knowest she is my all.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">His shining blue eyes filled with tears, and sobs heaved
in his breast. My mother wept for sorrow and joy, and
only I was tearless. This little book contained poems
written from the time of my confirmation to my thirtieth
year, of which my mother had seen hardly any, for they
had, except on very exceptional occasions, been hidden
from those nearest and dearest to me.”</p>

<p>Amongst them were the two following poems written
in <span class="locked">English:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>After her return to Bucharest, Princess Elizabeth
began to illuminate in water-colours in the style of a
missal. These works of art were quickly completed by
her clever hands. On the 23rd of November she writes
in a letter from Bucharest&mdash;“Art in all its forms is but
a prayer. Consequently, when it is inspired, it brings
peace and joy into the hearts of others. Art places us
on the Virful-cu-Dor (the Heights of Longing), and
whilst she shows us the world at our feet, still she
directs our longing gaze upwards. Then peace, perfect
peace returns to us.”</p>

<p>“<i>Bucharest, December 26, 1874.</i>&mdash;To-morrow at eight
o’clock the poor receive their Christmas gifts. Wood
and clothes are distributed to a thousand poor people.
Tuesday is a festival and day of rest, on which I shall
not say, ‘Oh, were I never born!’ For I am glad that
I live, and can have manifold experiences, and think and
hope. I think life is a blessing which has given me
more than enough, for instance this translating and this
painting, which comes into my life as something new
and eventful. I think I must have taken some of the
woodland soil of my German home away with me, and
unexpected streams well up from under my feet. I
am thankful to you, my earthly gods, for this, for your
endless love, earnestness, and wealth of thought have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
made me the heiress of these your hardly-won treasures.
If I have a good idea, I ask myself, ‘From which of
my parents does it come, to whom am I beholden
for it?’”</p>

<p>“<i>January 7, 1875.</i>&mdash;I do not translate now, as I
am writing so much myself. As soon as I take up my
pen, original thoughts flow into my mind, and then it
is difficult for me to transcribe the thoughts of others.
What we create ourselves is the most beautiful, translating
the most useful. I am always under the immediate
impression of what I am reading, and so the
thoughts of Bernstein, and particularly a description
of the Atlantic cable, inspired my ‘Songs of the
Sea.’</p>

<p>“Paul Keyse’s ‘Balder’ set me making verses of the
same metre, which are so pleasant to compose. I have
arranged a Choral Society with Lubitz, the new musician,
with whom we sing in chorus. He is delighted with
the Roumanian songs, melodies, and words, and will
arrange them as a chorus. Our Choral Society makes
good progress. Our working classes are extending, and
with them the interest for the good cause. Herr
Hoetsch has given us a house for the Infant School
and the meetings of our Society. Three times a
week 160 to 170 women fetch their work from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
thence. Enough flowers grow on my thorny path to
refresh me.”</p>

<p>On the 7th of May the princely pair had moved up
to Cotroceni. “The nightingales are singing, and the
damp earth has an agreeable scent. It is absolutely
still. The first thing I did was to set free thirty
nightingales which I had bought in the market for
sixty francs. Perhaps they will stay here. You
should have seen how the poor little birds, still quite
stiff from their fetters, at first remained on my hand,
then slowly stretched their necks, and then it was but
one beat of their wings and they were free! I
rejoiced each time! Here I shall set to work again.
What hinders me most is the want of interest of those
who know too little German and too little Roumanian
to be able to help me to understand. Perhaps I shall
take drawing lessons from the new directress of the
Asyle, Madame Pinel, a scholar of Horace Vernet, and
thereby entice one young lady after the other. In this
way I should be able to found a school of drawing in
the same manner as the Choral Society by mixing with
the scholars.”</p>

<p>On the 19th of July 1875 the Princess writes from
Sinaia:&mdash;“How I have longed for the forest! Yesterday
I told it to the Pelesch, whose rushing and foaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
waterfall seemed to make moan, the leaves of the
beech trees whispered and trembled and the sunbeams
came flying to me. All promised me new songs, and
said that if they were eternal and unceasing my poetry
must be so too.”</p>

<p>Finding it impossible to make a fixed residence in
the uncomfortable apartments which were all that the
convent at Sinaia could offer, the Prince began to
build a castle of his own in the woods. At the place
which had been the favourite haunt of the little Princess
Marie, the foundation stone of Castle Pelesch was laid
on the 22nd of August 1875. The wishes of the
Princess as to the spirit which should reign in this new
home are laid in the foundation-stone with the archives
and the coins. They are expressed as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The quiet valley of Sinaia has quite changed its
character, and is now like a colony in the back woods,
with wooden huts and wigwams. Twelve to fourteen
languages are spoken on the place where the castle is
building. The overseer of the works is the Court
sculptor, Martin Stohr. His wood-carvings adorn the
Castle and the Palace in Bucharest, and remind one of
the first period of the Renaissance by their wonderful
finish. Upon a great height among the gigantic forests,
and on soil belonging to the Prince, is a magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
stone quarry which furnishes all the stone required for
the building of the castle. A small railway leads up
to it, and there the Italian workmen have taken up their
abode. The building of the line of railway through the
Prahova Valley was begun at the same time as that
of the castle.”</p>

<p>But the footsteps of the Princess became weary and
weak again, till illness once more completely prostrated
her. As she lay in bed for months, unable to put her
foot to the ground, the Princess, as has already been
mentioned, found courage to write down a complete
account of the life of her remarkable brother, Prince
Otto. Princess Elizabeth was content, in spite of her
sufferings, and wrote to her mother on the 28th of
November:&mdash;“You cannot fancy how grateful I am for
the quiet that this winter brings. I have so often said
to God in the course of the summer&mdash;‘I can no more’&mdash;that
He has shown that my strength is at an end,
and that I must concentrate and recover my powers.
No turbulent wave swells into my boudoir, and the
restlessness without only feeds the world of thought
in my quiet room.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>“<i>4th December.</i>&mdash;This quiet is more than a blessing
to me. During the last year my mind and body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
have been craving for rest. Now I have at last
attained to it, and am very thankful. Why are there
so many commonplace people and so few that are
interesting? They all keep a firm hold on me, like so
many leeches, and do not understand that quiet peace is
the ideal of life, the highest aim of the Epicureans.”</p>

<p>“<i>13th December.</i>&mdash;I have finished another story, but
it is a very sad one. The pictures my fancy paints
are seldom bright; indeed they never were. My childish
stories even were always sad and dreadful. I think
that laughter dwells outside, and not within me, and is
but hung about me like a bright garment. Or is it the
wonderful brightness of your nature and my father’s
which is struggling within me, or is it life and its
sorrows? Are our sad experiences alone worth dwelling
upon? Who can tell?”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Prince Charles was ill, and Princess Elizabeth still
unable to walk. She longed for some of her family to
visit her, but none of them could come to her. This
increased her melancholy state of mind. “And during
this long illness I tasted all the bitterness of life, the
very depths of hopelessness and despair which could
abide in the heart of man. But comfort is sent to all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
I have my pen, which is given to me for drawing,
and poetry, and which make up to me for everything!
It flies ever quicker, for the stream of my thoughts
flows continuously, and the scene of my labours enlarges
and increases with my anxiety for the well-being of
others.”</p>

<p>At last the Princess of Wied was expected. Her
Highness arrived in May, and stayed till August with
her children in Cotroceni and Sinaia, to the great
delight of Princess Elizabeth, who had now quite
recovered her health. This meeting, which she had so
long anxiously looked forward to, found an echo in the

<p>After her mother had left, she writes to her in
September:&mdash;“Sinaia looks the same as of old, it is so
full of merriment, of life and joy. People stream in
and out, and then I am quite well again. We make
voyages of discovery and start on climbing excursions
every day. In all states of life it is pleasanter to be
the stronger one who can impart to others some of his
<i>trop plein</i> than the weak one who goes a-begging.
What an enjoyment it is not to depend on others! For
the first time since many years I feel as if I were carried
by the air when I am walking, and yet I am no sylph.
We now live in the house in the wood from half-past
eight in the morning till half-past seven in the evening.
It is quite ideal, like a nest amidst the green, and really
a little paradise, so cosy and so warm among the fir-trees.”</p>

<p>When autumn comes in, Bucharest becomes once
more the centre of ever-renewing duties. Then the
Princess resumes her life of hard work. She rises at
five in the morning, and lighting her little lamp herself,
she works till eight in a room artistically adorned with
paintings, palms, and towering ferns. Thick carpets
hush the sound of footsteps. The walls are hung with
deep-toned colours. Cosy little nooks and corners to
sit in are arranged under tropical plants. The silence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
which surrounds the Princess is only broken by the
murmur of the little fountain and the chirping of the
birds. In these early morning hours the Princess
works at her poetic creations, and gains strength for
the cares and duties of the day.</p>

<p>After breakfasting alone with the Prince, businesses
and audiences begin. The reception-rooms of Prince
and Princess are often not empty for nine or ten
hours with but short interruptions. At a particular
hour the former ladies-in-waiting who have been married
since then, may see the Princess without being announced.
Every Thursday a concert takes place. Foreigners and
natives are invited to take part on these occasions.
Some times Roumanian gentlemen read aloud either a
scientific French book or the works of modern Roumanian
poets. Princess Elizabeth wishes to be thoroughly well-informed,
and every talent finds a patroness in her. “I
have arranged something very pleasant,” she writes to
her mother. “Twice a week I get Vacaresco to read
ancient Roumanian Chronicles to me. He is as well up
in them as a professor, and holds explanatory lectures
between whiles, which are open to all. Imagine my
ideal room with its fountains and lamps and abatjours,
the pretty girls with their work under the spreading
palms, and I, pen in hand, noting down every new word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
And then the curious past which is unrolled before
us, in a magnificent classical Latin style, or in the
primitive forms of the old books of the Bible. I hope
to find subjects to work up in poetry. I am also
arranging an Academy of Painting. There is to be
much singing and more reading aloud. Everything
that approaches me must be at work. Nobody and
nothing may rest.”</p>

<p>“It is a peculiarity of mine to like to be surrounded
by many workers. I do not at all like a <i>tête-à-tête</i>:
it always wants three people to make up a pleasant
conversation. In a <i>tête-à-tête</i> one usually touches on
one’s little miseries about which it is much better
to be silent. I always live with open doors, so
that people may come to me at any time. This is a
slight alleviation to my childlessness. I only reserve
the first hours from five to eight for my own work.
After that I let any one disturb me, and begin with
my household affairs and the menu. Consequently I
often have people from ten in the morning till seven
at night.”</p>

<p>“The Prince likes to find me at every free moment
he has, and so I am always at home. He must never
notice that I am at work. When he calls or I hear
his footsteps, pen and paint brush are thrown away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
till he does not want me any more. For as he has
much work to do, and sees many people, we must make
use of and prize the quarters of an hour which belong
to us alone. If I were to hesitate for a moment
the time would be gone and could not be reclaimed.
Also I think that I am first a wife, then the mother of
my country, and then a poetess. But, thank God, the
genius of poetry goes secretly with me to the audiences,
to the forests, and to the schools, to dinners too, &amp;c.
Anything and everything gives occasion to endless
studies, and I gather treasures in my memory which
has ever been a trusty companion to me.”</p>

<p>“In politics the Prince is my oracle, and I avoid discussing
them with any one else. He gives me lectures
on political economy, finances, railways, and the army&mdash;everything
in fact which concerns him. He has a very
decided turn for organisation. All his talents are
exactly the contrary of mine. Demeter Stourdza said
lately that he had never seen two people so complete
in one another, and yet we could not be more different,
said I. ‘Yes,’ he answered, ‘the ways differ, but the
idea is ever the same.’” (From letters of the Queen in
May and June 1884.)</p>

<p>But the quiet life of the royal pair was soon interrupted
by the beginning of a devastating war. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
development of the fatal Eastern Question was to introduce
a new epoch, which not only converted Roumania
into a theatre of war, but also induced her to take an
active part in it herself. This decision was crowned
with many and brilliant successes.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Threatening</span> clouds had arisen on the
political horizon. The condition of the
Christian inhabitants of the tributary
Turkish provinces had become untenable.
Servia and Montenegro had declared war with Turkey.
The rebellion had broken out in Bosnia, in Herzegovina,
and in Bulgaria. Russia had taken up the case in a
warlike spirit which drove her irresistibly forward. To
free the Slavonic brothers from the yoke of Turkey was
the long desired object of Panslavistic thought. The
Emperor Alexander II. held it to be his sacred duty to
go to the help of the oppressed Christians who were one
with him in name and in faith. The decision of Russia
to settle the Eastern Question by force of arms decided
the point. On the 13th of November 1876 the
Emperor commanded that six army corps in the south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
of Russia should be put in motion, and he placed them
under the command of his brother, the Grand Duke
Nicholas. On the 24th of April 1877 the Russian
troops had crossed the Pruth and were marching through
Roumania.</p>

<p>On the 26th of April 1877 Prince Charles of
Roumania opened the extraordinary session of parliament
in a solemn speech. He said&mdash;“War is broken out: our
efforts in regard to Turkey and the guaranteeing powers
that our neutrality should be accorded to us as our right
have been without success. We have borne many sacrifices
for the upholding of this neutrality, and it is
required as a duty from us even by foreign cabinets.
The Porte has refused even to lay our requests before
the conference now assembled in Constantinople. Under
these conditions Roumania, no longer supported by other
powers, must in future depend upon its own exertions.
It is our duty to prevent this land from becoming the
theatre of war at any price, and to make any sacrifices
required for this object. Such a war would reduce
our towns and villages to ashes, our people would be
massacred, and our riches, the fruits of the labours of a
peace of twenty years, would be scattered by this war,
which we did not wish for, and which has not been
declared by any fault of ours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
A few days later, on the 7th of May, the Prince
had to address the assembled Senate in the following
<span class="locked">words&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Notwithstanding all our efforts to the contrary, the
war that has broken out between our two powerful
neighbours has already led to disastrous results in the
part of our country that lies by the Danube. Without
a single bullet having fallen on our territory, our towns
and villages are beginning to be ruined and deserted,
for the Ottoman monitors, regardless of all international
law, forced themselves into our harbours and burned and
destroyed the ships that lay at anchor there, regardless
of the flag under which they sailed. Unprotected towns,
as Braila, and particularly Reni, have been bombarded.
Olteniza, where not the smallest division of the Russian
army is to be found, shared the same fate. Marauding
bands of Bashi-Bazouks have disturbed the peace of the
country in various places, have crossed the Danube, and
have burnt the ships lying at anchor in the river Jiul in
the harbour of Beket, and destroyed the dwellings of the
people.”</p>

<p>Nothing more remained to be done but for Roumania
to get rid of the enemy by main force. On the 8th of
May the Turks had opened a bombardment on Kalafat
from Widdin. Their cannon balls fell into the Danube,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
and their firing was answered by the Roumanian forts.
Thus fell the first Roumanian shot against the Turks.
The cannon had spoken, and had settled the question.
“Now the bands that connected us with Turkey are
broken,” said the Roumanians, “and may they be eternally
severed. The time of our guardianship by foreign
powers and the times of our servitude is over. Roumania
is and will remain a free and independent state.”</p>

<p>The declaration of the independence of Roumania was
solemnly announced to the people on the 22nd of May
1877. “From the day on which I set foot on this
ground I became a Roumanian,” said the Prince to his
subjects. “From the day on which I ascended this
throne which has become famous by many great and
glorious Princes, the ideas of those Princes have become
the dominant idea of my reign&mdash;namely, the resurrection
of Roumania and the fulfilment of her mission in the
mouths of the Danube.” Prince Charles had already
signed a convention with Russia, and a Russo-Roumanian
alliance followed soon after.</p>

<p>The war was now in full swing! On the 27th of
May a cannonade had taken place between Kalafat and
Widdin. The battery of Carol I., with which were
the Prince and his suite, and the officers of the staff,
fired the first shot. After the second shot, all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
Turkish batteries began to open fire, and a lively
cannonade was continued on both sides. The first
bombshell flew over the battery of Carol I., and burst
quite close to where the Prince was standing, but
without doing him any harm. “Charles has brought
me the bombshell which burst at his side,” writes the
Princess. “They told me that he stood on the ramparts
surrounded by shot and shell. Some of the people
crossed themselves, and Greciano fell on his knees,
for he thought his Prince was wounded. But Charles
waved his cap and cried ‘Hurrah! Bravo! Je suis
habitué à cette musique-là!’ Then a loud hurrah!
resounded from all the batteries, and was taken up by
the whole camp, from whence it extended to the town,
and all the military bands began to play the National
Anthem. It must have been a thrilling moment!
Three bombshells burst later in the battery where Charles
stood. In Craiova they wished to unharness the horses
and drag the carriage themselves, and threw wreaths
and bouquets, doves, and even small loaves of bread
into his carriage.” Carmen Sylva’s enthusiastic poem,
entitled “Kalafat,” was written in honour of this
memorable day.</p>

<p>The Emperor Alexander of Russia had arrived on a
visit to the princely pair at Bucharest, on the 25th of
June, accompanied by the Grand Dukes, the Chancellor,
the Ministers of War, Ignatieff, and other high personages,
all coming from Plojest. “It was certainly one
of the most interesting days for Roumania,” the Princess
writes in a letter, “and I enjoyed it very much in the
feeling that I am helping to act a piece of history.
The reception of the Emperor was enthusiastic, and
we were literally buried under the quantities of roses
thrown. From one balcony roses and golden tinsel
were scattered together. I have never seen anything
more beautiful, and shall not forget the picture.” The
Prince writes&mdash;“I am proud of Elizabeth, who does
the honours charmingly. The Emperor, the Grand
Dukes, and all the Russians are charmed with her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
and say that she reminds them of the Grand Duchess
Hélène.”</p>

<p>This visit of the Emperor, immediately after the
declaration of the independence of Roumania, was an
event of great importance. By his appearance in
Bucharest his Majesty had sanctioned the political
position of the country at that time. After the repulse
of the first Russian attacks on Plevna, the Roumanian
divisions, under the command of the Prince, crossed the
Danube and joined the Russian army. As soon as it
was settled that Roumania was to take an active part
in the war, Princess Elizabeth made all the arrangements
required to mitigate the horrors of it.</p>

<p>In thus undertaking the office of a sister of charity,
the Princess demonstrated that this was the vocation
of every woman at such a time, and her example was
cheerfully followed by the Roumanian ladies in the
most unselfish and self-sacrificing manner. The vast
throne-room had been transformed into a centre of
loving service. At the command of the Princess, and
with her active help, linen and bandages were prepared.
In the halls where the official receptions were usually
held, and where hundreds of people danced to the
sound of Strauss’ Waltzes, the wheels of the sewing-machines
were now in ceaseless motion. Women of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
all ranks and nationalities went in and out, vieing
with each other to supply the troops, now actively
engaged with the enemy, with all sorts of necessaries.
Many poor peasant women also came to the Princess
saying&mdash;“Your Highness has supplied us with wood
and work for years, and now we will work for a week
for the Red Cross without wages.”</p>

<p>The Princess had to accept their services in order not
to hurt their feelings. At her own expense the Princess
reared a hospital for one hundred beds in the park at
Cotroceni, which was to be under her own supervision&mdash;“As
she wished to nurse her children herself.” The
Princess also worked unceasingly in all the other hospitals
which she had organised. She awaited and received
every train which brought in the wounded from the
field of battle, and nursed and tended them unwearyingly,
without giving herself a thought. Day and night the
Princess was at work, refreshing the weary and comforting
and encouraging the sick. She helped to bind up
the wounds herself, and did not even recoil from those
at sight of which even men could not help shuddering.
How many of the dying received the last words of
comfort from her lips! Many of them would only take
chloroform from her hands, and she alone could persuade
many of the wounded to undergo the necessary amputations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
The pride of the Roumanian soldier rebelled
against going through life like a cripple, without a leg
or an arm. “I would rather die than look like a
beggar!” exclaimed a young soldier in despair whose
leg was to be taken off. But the Princess came to his
bedside and besought him to remember that a long life
might still lie before him, and to let the operation take
place. “For your sake, Regina, it shall be done!” he
murmured. Obstacles that none could surmount were
overcome by a kind word from the beloved Princess.
She exercised a great moral power over the poor
sufferers.</p>

<p>“What a satisfaction it must be to your Serene
Highness,” wrote a lady of the Court to the Princess of
Wied, “to know how our beloved Princess is fulfilling
her duty as mother to her country. Your beloved
daughter goes from one bedside to another, and has a
word of comfort for each and all of the sick and wounded,
encouraging the down-hearted and praising and thanking
all that had distinguished themselves by their
bravery. She has such a wonderful power over them
that she wins a smile from all, even those that are
suffering acutely or sorrowing over a lost limb.”</p>

<p>And with what enthusiasm the soldiers looked up to
their Princess! What an expression of joy shone in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
the wan features of the sufferers when she came near
them! And when they were restored to health, the
grateful sons of the soil told of the good Dòamna
Elisabeta in their humble homes in the valleys and
mountains of the Carpathians. Since that time the
people call the Princess “Muma Ranitilor,” the Mother
of the Wounded. At this time of danger, when the
greatest demands were made upon her powers, the
strength of this exalted woman seemed to be doubled.
Thus she again displayed her innate administrative
talent. Quiet and self-composed when others were
passionate and despairing, the Princess never lost her
presence of mind, but was able to direct and control
even the most perplexing affairs. Being unable to sleep
for more than two or three hours, because of her
dreadful anxiety as to the fate of the Prince and the
army, Princess Elizabeth often made music and wrote
poetry half the night for her relaxation. At four
in the morning she was often wandering up and
down and ordering in her mind her heavy work for
the day.</p>

<p>Many battles had been fought, and much blood had
been shed on the field. The heroic army of Roumania
had borne off new victories when Rahova and Grivitza
were taken. Prince Charles undertook the command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
of a Russo-Roumanian army which was drawn up
around Plevna. His troops fought with the courage of
lions, notwithstanding the dreadful losses they sustained,
and performed prodigies of valour when Prince Charles,
shouting “May God help us!” led them wherever the
battle was at its fiercest. Plevna had fallen, and Osman
Pasha surrendered. On the 10th of December 1877
the Prince of Roumania entered into Plevna amidst
the indescribable enthusiasm of his troops. At seven
o’clock in the evening he proceeded to Poradim to
report to the Emperor on the results of that wonderful
day.</p>

<p>The Prince had been brave and courageous as a soldier,
but cautious and wary as the commander of an army.
As a strategist he had often been in a position to show
that he knew how to lead his troops. The people regarded
him with the greatest enthusiasm as the champion
of their freedom. Immeasurable sacrifices had been
bought, and a time of great anxiety had been passed
through; but the Roumanians thought of the future, and
comforted themselves with what history has so often
demonstrated, “that the freedom of a country is only
to be dearly bought on fields of battle.” The independence
of Roumania had now been acknowledged by all
European States. All classes of the people were proudly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
conscious that their freedom and independence had been
bravely won.</p>

<p>The occupation of Widdin had been the crowning act
of the Roumanian army. After that had been accomplished
they left the fields of Bulgaria, where so many
of their comrades had found a grave, and returned to
their hearths and homes.</p>

<p>The strength of the Princess had lasted as long
as it was so urgently required. But when peace was
assured, the misery lessened, and the last occupants
of the hospital had left, her Highness broke down
completely. Only in strengthening mountain air could
she hope to restore her shattered health. So the
Court was again removed to the old monastery of
the Carpathians in Sinaia.</p>

<p>During her stay there the Princess received a very
touching proof of the gratitude of her people.</p>

<p>It was on a Sunday. The excursion train had brought
over more than one thousand people to Sinaia, of which
the greater number streamed to see the new castle which
was building, to the forest and the valley of the Pelesch.
Suddenly a woman clothed in black advanced to meet
the Princess. She seemed to wish to offer her something
which she held in her outstretched hand. Princess
Elizabeth, who imagined it was a petition, was going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
accept it in the usual way. But with that dignity which
distinguishes the Roumanian people the woman stepped
back, saying, “Oh, no; I do not want anything. I am
the widow of a tradesman, and have no daughter to whom
I can leave the family jewellery which we have treasured
for many generations. But you are the mother of the
poor and the wounded, and have done us so much good.
I know of no one worthier than you to wear the precious
treasure, and I pray you to accept it, for I would offer
it to you.” Upon this she handed a gold bracelet of
ancient Roman coins to the Princess. Surprised and
deeply touched, the royal lady received this tribute of
the love of her people with the warmest thanks&mdash;that
bracelet is regarded as one of the most treasured ornaments
of the Princess, for the love and gratitude of their
people is the brightest jewels of their rulers.</p>

<p>After some time the health of the Princess Elizabeth
was so far restored that she could risk being present at
the fêtes of victory.</p>

<p>The streets of Bucharest were gaily decorated on the
20th of October 1878, for Prince Charles, the hero of
the people, was to enter the capital at the head of his
victorious army. Garlands of flowers were hung from
one house to another. A figure of Victory stood on the
high triumphal arch, the so well deserved laurel wreath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
in her right hand. It was a lovely autumnal day, and
from early morning the streets were filled with crowds
of people eager to welcome the troops. Bands of music
marched at the head of the procession, followed by a
detachment of slightly wounded soldiers. Behind them
fifty-six cannons rattled on, each bearing the name of
the place where it had been captured. And then Prince
Charles himself appeared. Who shall describe the shouts
and acclamations which greeted him, and who count the
wreaths which were thrown at his approach! His look
was firm and yet gentle, and on that day he must have
realised that his labours had not been in vain. The
hearty welcome accorded to him showed more than all
the flags and garlands that he had become the idol of
his people.</p>

<p>The troops followed their commander who had led
them to victory with songs and cheers. Princess
Elizabeth appeared in their midst in an open carriage,
before which countless flowers were thrown by her grateful
people. And what the soldiers sang was a war-song
composed by their Princess. It had inspired them in
the midst of many battles, and the following translation
will give an idea of <span class="locked">it:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The 20th of October was a great day for free
Roumania. The Princess writes:&mdash;“What a year has
ended! At first I had sufficient courage to sustain
all, and inspired all with my confidence. It was a difficult
position for a woman alone, I can assure you. I
forgot my anxiety in the amount of work I had to get
through. Let us thank God that Charles has returned,
for now I can creep back slowly into my nutshell, and
return to my flowers, my birds, my books, and my
papers. I think it is an anomaly and a misfortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
when a woman is induced by circumstances to take
part in public life. But there were many bright
spots in this difficult time. God will surely help us,
and a lasting peace will take away the anxiety which
is gnawing at our hearts, and this important time will
belong to the future, in which sorrow and suffering is
modified, and the great results that are won thereby
will be brought out into strong relief. Charles is truly
wonderful! I often compare him to William the Silent
or to King Charles on his sea voyage. The bitterest experiences
only make him colder and calmer. He shrugs
his shoulders and forgives every ingratitude. That all
misunderstand him in no way disconcerts him. When he
is dead they will lament and call him ‘a wise Prince.’”</p>

<p>When the war was over, the wives of all the officers
of the Roumanian army presented the “Mother of their
Country” with a marble statue. In this the Princess is
represented in the costume of a Sister of Charity as she
kneels before a wounded soldier, reaching him a refreshing
draught. The recollection of what the Princess
accomplished during this war, by giving up herself and
all her strength to the work, and by her wonderful talent
for organisation, will dwell with many feelings of deep
gratitude in the hearts of her people, and one generation
will tell another of her noble and self-sacrificing deeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
In 1879 Princess Elizabeth had been in Scheveningen
with her mother, and had returned strengthened and
refreshed to her country. In the next year (1880)
the princely pair went to Segenhaus and Amsterdam
together. Many relations also came to visit them at
Bucharest and Sinaia, amongst others Prince William
of Wied, and Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern, with his
two sons, Ferdinand and Charles. In September 1881
the Princess of Hohenzollern (mother of Prince Charles
of Roumania) travelled to Roumania for the first time,
and was received with great joy by the people. “It
is too delightful,” writes the Princess, “to have such
an angel of a mother in her. She is always surrounded
by an atmosphere of harmony and tenderness which is
quite fascinating. The monks in Sinaia, when she
arrived there, were very anxious to know which place
should be given to her at table, and when they were
told ‘the place of honour,’ they joyfully exclaimed&mdash;‘That
is what King Solomon did when his mother
came to him; he seated her on his throne, knelt down
before her and kissed her hand. Our King Charles
does the same, whom may God bless and preserve to
a long life!’ Is this not prettier than many a village
tale!” On the 12th of December 1880 the Princess
continues&mdash;“A very touching scene was enacted lately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
The Ministers came to thank us for having settled
the question of succession. Bratiano read his speech
with tears in his eyes, after which I gave him my
hand, and he said&mdash;‘Etre brave dans un moment
d’enthousiasme c’est beau, mais être brave à froid c’est
de l’héroisme!’”</p>

<p>On the 24th of March 1881 Roumania was declared
a kingdom by Act of Parliament. Demeter Stourdza,
the Minister for Foreign Affairs, wrote to the Princess
of Wied&mdash;“A happy fate indeed guides Roumania, for
the most complicated affairs turn out to be for her
good. This so constant shining of our lucky star
quite frightens me. A sense of duty, a love of duty,
and a strict performance of one’s duty, must keep it
bright, and prevent it from fading before us. On the
22nd of May the whole country is to do homage to its
sovereign, and a kingly crown, with a battle-axe which
has been made out of a cannon taken at Plevna, are
to be presented to the Prince, as a symbol of the
great events of the war and his newly-acquired position.”
Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern had come to
Bucharest with his two sons, Ferdinand and Charles, to
take part in this festive occasion.</p>

<p>The evening before the day of this ceremonial salvoes
of artillery had been fired. Multitudes of people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
streamed into the town to see the coronation, forming
a motley crowd. The two crowns had been taken to the
cathedral with much pomp and ceremony. There they
were received by the metropolitans, bishops, and minor
clergy, who were chanting solemnly, and placed on
tables draped with red before the sacred images. At
the close of a short service these insignia of royalty
were respectfully kissed by the minister and the clergy.
They were then covered with the glorious monuments
of the siege of Plevna. These were four flags of the
Roumanian army which were torn to shreds and decorated
with the highest orders of the country. These
emblems of royalty remained in the Metropolia all night,
whilst a guard of honour kept watch around them.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the 22nd of May 1881, the
little girls from the Asyle Hélène, adorned with flowers,
advanced in long rows through the park of Cotroceni
and sang a morning hymn before the castle. It seemed
a happy omen to the Queen that the first words of love
which reached her on this memorable day resounded
from her little favourites as she awoke. At eight
o’clock in the morning already the houses and tiers of
seats erected in the town were filled with people, who
crowded every available space on the somewhat long way
to the cathedral, and were all anxious to see the sights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
According to the programme the procession to the
coronation was to be short. It started at eleven o’clock,
and was opened by a regiment of Dorobanzes, whose
bands were playing. They formed the Landwehr of
Roumania, and were the most popular of the troops, being
all tried and experienced men, richly adorned with
orders and medals. On their heads they wear the traditional
fur cap of the warrior Michel, which is adorned
with the feathers of turkeys, herons, and pheasants.
These were followed by a company of gendarmes and a
squadron of hussars, and then came the standard-bearers
of all the colours of the army, with a golden Roman
eagle surmounting them. Enthusiastic cheering and the
waving of hats and handkerchiefs greeted the King as
he appears mounted on his charger and surrounded by
his brilliant staff. The energy of a firm character
appears in his strongly marked features.</p>

<p>After this came the State carriage of the Queen.
It was harnessed à la Daumont, and drawn by eight
black horses, their harness adorned with feathers, and
ridden by jockeys who wore the colours of the country.
A large basket of flowers stood on the box of the
carriage, as well as on the seat behind, and on the steps.
Four footmen in State liveries marched on each side of
the carriage, and in front were two outriders whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
horses bore feathers of three colours. The slight form
of the Queen, clad in magnificent coronation robes, appeared
poetic as that of a fairy in this carriage draped
with red and filled to overflowing with flowers. Beside
her sat the hereditary Prince of Hohenzollern, and the
two young Princes opposite. At sight of her the
hundreds of thousands of spectators burst into loud
shouts of joy, which were carried on like echoes from
balcony to balcony. Branches of fir, the symbols of
respect and hospitality, and flowers sparkling with golden
powder, were thrown to the Queen from the windows,
and white doves adorned with flowers were set free by
their owners, and fluttered over the Queen, who was
radiant with beauty and grace. Many of these reached
their destination, the beautiful carriage, to which they
clung like messengers of peace.</p>

<p>All the magnificence and the sumptuous furnishings
of this romantic procession was concentrated at the foot
of the Metropolitan Hill, from whence the royal pair,
followed by their suites, proceeded on foot along the
avenue, where a scarlet carpet was laid to the church.
The representatives of three thousand country parishes,
with their pennons, had arranged themselves in closely
packed rows on each side of the carriage. Dressed in
their original national costume, these made a brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
background to the imposing picture. A large stand in
the shape of a horse-shoe had been erected in front of
the principal entrance to the church, which had long
before the arrival of their Majesties been filled with the
nobility and gentry of Roumania. In the middle of
this stand stood the royal tent, to which a carpeted
staircase led.</p>

<p>The royal pair, with the Prince of Hohenzollern, had
taken their places. Then the religious ceremony began,
and was celebrated with all the pomp of the orthodox
Greek Church. During the singing four generals carried
the two crowns from the interior of the church to
the royal tent, where they were consecrated, and their
Majesties received the holy water. The close of this
solemn occasion was the signing of the document which
Demeter Bratiano laid before their Majesties. Afterwards
the deed was signed by Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern,
and the Minister Bratiano, who acted as witnesses
of the weighty affair of state which had just been concluded.
Thundering salvoes of artillery announced that
this historic ceremony was concluded. The return of
their Majesties was like a triumphal procession. Quantities
of flowers were showered upon them, and the waving
of handkerchiefs reminded one of a swarm of butterflies,
which seemed to follow the procession. Endless rows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
carriages containing the guests and the diplomatic corps
followed the principal actors in the scene, all returning
to the Palace at about three o’clock.</p>

<p>Many groups of peasant women from Plojest and
Campulung had stationed themselves amongst the people
who crowded into the open space before the grand
entrance to the Palace. They are the cream of the
district of the Carpathians. On this occasion they
insisted on being noticed by the Queen, for it was widely
known that her Majesty delighted in the national costume
of the country, and the women were proud to show themselves
to her in their richest dress, the ornaments of
which sparkled in the sun like thousands of little plates
of glass.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the immense procession bearing
the two crowns to the Palace advanced in almost unending
length. The veterans of 1848 and those that had
been wounded in the last war marched first, whilst the
ten thousand members of the deputations of the peasants
formed the rearguard. The doors of the vast throne-room
had been opened wide, and sixty standard-bearers,
with the flags and banners of the army, were ranged
around it. The sounds of the triumphal march were
heard from afar, and the crowns, borne by four generals,
and accompanied by a solemn procession of the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
officers of State, were placed at the foot of the throne.
At half-past two the royal pair appeared, and were
solemnly conducted to the throne by the Senate and
the Members of Parliament. On their left stood Prince
Leopold of Hohenzollern; on their right, his sons. Prince
Demeter Ghica addressed their Majesties, and presented
the iron crown to the King, whilst Rossetti, the President
of the Houses of Parliament, advanced towards the Queen,
and kneeling before her, offered her a golden crown, with
the following words&mdash;“In your Majesty the nation sees
itself most gloriously represented.” Then the King began
an eloquent speech whilst lifting up the crown and bearing
it aloft over his people as though he were blessing them.
He spoke of the steady progress of Roumania and of her
brave army, and closed with the words&mdash;“The love and
confidence of the nation, whose happiness and increasing
power is my all absorbing thought and that of the Queen,
was and ever will be our most precious diadem.” At
these words from their King, the vast concourse assembled
gave vent to their feelings of love and enthusiasm by an
irresistible outburst of shouts of applause.</p>

<p>The deputations of peasants now passed before the
throne. These honest men were visibly affected, and
many among them wiped a tear from his eye with his
rough hand. Most of them threw themselves at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
feet of their Majesties, and did homage to them, kissing
the steps of their throne. With touching simplicity
and much difficulty others threw addresses of congratulation
out of their pockets, coat-sleeves, and
pocket-books, depositing them at the feet of the royal
pair; whilst others brought branches of fir-trees which
they had gathered in their native mountains and
anxiously preserved during their long journey. Later
in the day, the whole concourse of the country people
were encamped before the town, where a banquet with
music awaited them, the enjoyment of which was
heightened by the presence and affable manners of
the King. There was a brilliant illumination in the
evening. The peasants were enchanted “to see the
sun at night,” as they expressed themselves! And
the Court with its guests found it difficult to wend
its way through the elated crowds.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding her delicate health the Queen had
borne the fatigues of that day tolerably. She says&mdash;“We
spoke with eight hundred people on that day,
from eleven o’clock till half-past four, and at half-past
eight we were again ‘sous les armes!’ Then came a
procession of torches, and a drive round the town to
see the illuminations. At last I could not bow any
more, but only wave with my handkerchief. Fortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
they had stopped the cheering, as I could stand
it no longer. This enormous and now silent crowd,
which greeted us and nodded and waved in the most
demonstrative manner, and the stamping of those feet
and hoofs which one did not see, made a most weird
and charming impression. Yes, from morning to night,
the 22nd of May was a beautiful day!” Seldom has a
day been marked with so much fervour and unaffected
devotion as this day on which the people of Roumania
came in such crowds to do homage to their King! This
day has become a day of national rejoicing for the
Roumanians. On the 22nd of May 1866 Prince
Charles of Roumania first entered Bucharest. Eleven
years later, on the 22nd of May 1877, Roumania was
declared independent. And on the 22nd of May 1881
the first King of Roumania was crowned. These three
historically important events make clear to us in a
few words the gradual development of this young
kingdom.</p>

<p>Thus Roumania had not alone gained her independence
by means of the war and its brilliant results,
but had been incorporated as a kingdom amongst the
European States. A strictly constitutional monarch is
the emblem of the banner which Prince Charles upholds
at his distant post. The object of his life is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
to strengthen his country within and without, and to
further its political and social development. Future
generations only will be able to understand and acknowledge
to its full extent all that he has done for
Roumania.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> the second half of this century, royal
ladies have realised that their duty consisted
in actively promoting all works of
charity and encouraging them by their
influence, as well as furthering the social and educational
welfare of their people. And that this practical knowledge
which can adapt itself to circumstances can be
combined with ideal interests and high endeavours,
is demonstrated by the noble and beautiful example
of Queen Elizabeth of Roumania. It is the highest
joy of artistic natures to see one of their own conceptions
carried out and to find it flourish and expand. In
this the educator is to be compared to the artist, for
character is formed by the educational artist. A longing
desire to educate others had possessed Queen
Elizabeth from earliest youth. When we see her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
making the education of children one of her first
objects, we know that it is prompted by true and heartfelt
feelings.</p>

<p>The Queen follows the course of studies and the
development of the pupils in the Asyle Hélène, the
orphanage already alluded to, with peculiar interest.
The well-known Doctor Davela had founded and
endowed this institution with his private means, and
conducted it personally for many years aided by his
excellent wife. Both died too soon. They bequeathed
their care for the orphans as a legacy to the Queen.
Four hundred and sixty young girls are now educated
there from their fifth to their twentieth year. There
they are taught all sciences, the arts, foreign languages,
needlework, book-keeping, &amp;c., and remain in the institution
till they have passed their final examination
as governesses or otherwise. The good name of this
institution is so widely known that young men look for
a wife from the Asyle Hélène, as they know she will be
capable. Many merchants, clergymen, and schoolmasters
come to the Principals of the College and ask them
as a favour to recommend a young girl to them whom
they consider fit for their mode of life. A meeting is
arranged, and if the young people suit one another,
they are usually married in the Chapel of the Asyle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
If the pupils marry clergymen or schoolmasters, most
of them become teachers in their new home, and are
capable of earning three hundred francs a month.</p>

<p>The Queen does not often visit the institutions&mdash;“And
then only to encourage and help them.” “For
I find,” she says, “that we do well to let those act
who understand the matter better than we do. The
Grand Duchess Hélène, who is my example, displayed
her interest in such things by caring for every detail
rather than by visiting them.” The royal lady is
present at all the examinations in the girls’ school,
as well as at the School of Music. She awards the
prizes with her own hands, and increases their value
by kind and considerate words which delight both
teachers and scholars.</p>

<p>The Queen founded a School of Embroidery, “The
Scola Elisabeta Doamna,” at her own expense. At
this institution seventy of the poorest peasant girls
receive free instruction in reading and writing, and
especially in the national embroidery. Very beautiful
patterns, mostly Byzantine, are collected and used to
decorate the national costumes. The peasant girls
often copy the patterns on ancient ecclesiastical robes,
or imitate a natural flower with a needle and thread.
Certain styles of embroidery are hereditary and peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
to each district. Thus many and original combinations
are formed, and the eye is attracted by their ever-varying
colour and form. All Roumanian women,
whether high or lowly, have an inborn and highly
cultivated eye for colour. They execute minute and
difficult patterns most tastefully upon the peculiar linen
woven in the country.</p>

<p>The first society for the help of the poor which the
Queen arranged was the “Société Elisabeth.” It distributes
yearly thirty thousand francs’ worth of fuel to
the poor. This society, to which about one hundred
ladies belong, arranges two to four balls every winter,
which take place in the Opera House with a Tombala.
These balls are honoured by the presence of the King
and Queen and the members of the aristocracy. All
the ladies wear the Roumanian costume on these evenings,
in order that the peasant women may earn a
good sum in winter by the sale of their embroideries.
Under the patronage of the Queen societies of the
same description have sprung up in many parts of
the country.</p>

<p>Not only does the large charitable association
“Société de bienfaisance” owe its origin to the Queen,
but her Majesty has also started the German “Frauenverein”
in Roumania. “The Albina” gives work to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
poor women who can only do rough sewing. Ten
years ago this idea was started by six poor women
thus finding employment&mdash;now a thousand can get work
there. A hundred and thirty of these have already
bought sewing-machines, and the numbers increase
daily. Now (1888) they furnish thirty thousand tents
for the army, and sew all trousers, shirts, cravats, sheets,
and sacks for the soldiers, as well as for the prisons and
hospitals. When wood is distributed to the poor by
the Société Elisabeth, these women are considered first.
A fourth society is called “Concordia,” and its object
is to encourage all branches of native industry in the
country, amongst which weaving is especially furthered.
Although hemp grows wild in Roumania, all material
for the linen used by the army and the public institutions
had till then been brought from foreign
countries. New Schools of Weaving are instituted, and
the looms that have been idle for years have been
improved and put in motion. In order to carry out
these plans for the benefit of the country, the Queen
had written a letter to the Ministers, which was published
in the newspapers. In this letter she sought
their help in encouraging weaving in the country, and
guaranteeing that the State would undertake the goods
produced. This object could only be attained if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
requirements of the army, the hospitals, and prisons
could be produced and manufactured in the country.</p>

<p>As we have already mentioned whilst describing the
“Société Albina,” its efforts have been crowned with
success. On the tableland of Cotroceni, not far from
the Asyle Hélène, lie the huge barracks in which Queen
Elizabeth nursed the wounded during the war. The
new School of Weaving is established there for the
present. At first only forty looms could be employed,
but Parliament has voted two hundred thousand francs
for the building of a new School for Weaving. The
building required is to be erected on the great piece
of land before the barracks which King Charles had
presented to the orphanage. “We shall then use the
barracks for the manufacture of silk,” writes the Queen,
“for which the land has been planted with mulberry
trees. So one school after another will be erected
around us, following my motto, ‘Industry in the home,’
and will, please God, open out new sources of wealth
to our country.”</p>

<p>To the “Concordia” is added the Society of the
“Fornica,” which buys Roumanian work only, such as
embroidery, and the stuffs that are woven and spun,
and sells them again in a bazaar held for the purpose.
The peasant women bring the shirts they have sewn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
and their strips of embroidery, and bless their Queen
for having brought such honour to their national
costume. Branches of this institution have sprung
up in many towns. They embroider a great deal in
the mountains, as they have less hard work in the
fields there. In the plains, the women can only
embroider in the winter, as they must guide the oxen
in the plough in summer. In the workshop of the
little mountain town of Campo Lungo four hundred
women are employed.</p>

<p>In imitation of the German kitchens for the people,
the Queen has arranged soup kitchens in many parts
of the town, where the poor children from the Schools
of Embroidery receive their daily dinners from her.</p>

<p>During the war the Queen also started a Home for
Nursing Sisters at her own expense. She began with
two sisters, of whom she sent one to the Deaconesses
of Bethany at Berlin to be taught. The Deaconesses of
Bucharest wear a dark grey costume, with a white veil
and apron, which are picturesquely arranged. A black
cross on a lilac ribbon is worn round the neck. “Now
there are more than twenty of them at Bucharest,
and they increase in numbers, and are much thought
of. Many of them lately passed their examinations,
and received certificates for practising simple surgery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
They nurse in hospitals and private houses for five
francs a day, and are often sent for in the town. The
rich often give more than is asked, which enables the
sisters to visit the poor free of charge, and to bring
them food and medicine. Now five thousand francs
have been voted for the School of Embroidery, and
twenty thousand for the Home for the Sisters. We
hope to build a house of our own with our savings,
with a little hospital beside it, and to have something
over for aged and infirm sisters. I shall add to this
a School for Monthly Nurses, as so many women die
in their confinement.”</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth belongs to those highly favoured
ladies who, though surrounded by the pomp and state
of royalty, can sympathise with the sorrows of the poor
and suffering, and combine with this a lofty ideal of the
intellectual duties of life. The Queen does not weary
of helping where help is required. None appeal to her
in vain if they are really in need. Where poverty is to
be relieved, or cares to be lightened, the Queen’s practical
mind ever finds the right means and the best manner of
doing it. Her constant endeavour is to promote the
cultivation and industry of the country, and to awake a
feeling of self-confidence in the nation. To work for
others is the source of her own happiness. The following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
poem will show how anxious the Queen is to fulfil
her duties towards the country.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> poetical talents of Queen Elizabeth, which
she was so anxious to hide from public view,
have proved beneficial to her vocation as
mother of her country. A critic might
perhaps object to the absence of strict rules in her
poetry, but we rejoice to find such originality in
thought and feeling. The royal lady writes of what
she has thought and felt in a vivid and life-like manner.
A desire to communicate her feelings to others induces
her to write poetry. She says,&mdash;“When a thought takes
possession of me, it is not that I will, but I must put
it into words, and insert it in a poem, or it leaves me
no peace. How often have I bitterly bewailed my
poetic talent, and rebelled against Providence for placing
such a burden upon my shoulders; and now I know that
it is my greatest happiness, and a blessing to me which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
can also give pleasure to others. My greatest wish is to
write in such a manner that all may think they have
written it themselves. I do not wish to be anything
more than the voice which clothes the truth in acceptable
forms and takes all its harshness from it. Thus I can
ease many a heart of its burden, and what happiness it
is to show the beauties of truth, to realise and represent
the beautiful.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“‘Like an eagle the poet, as bold and as free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And warm as the glow of the sunshine must be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the sensitive plant he must tremble and quake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now wild as a torrent, now calm as a lake.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“The outer forms of what one writes have only to do
with what one has learnt. The ideas have to be lived
through, and can only be based on the past experiences
which formed one’s character. This is my comfort when
I tremble lest my talent should come to an end. It is
not at an end, for I yet live and learn. How often I
have struggled against writing anything down for weeks
and months. But it holds me as a spell till it is written
down. Then I forget it, and so utterly and entirely
that I often do not even recognise my own thoughts.
After all, writing is only a discharge of electricity. But
the battery cannot be properly replenished when the body
is weakened. Every carefully finished work is a step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
upon which one can set one’s foot firmly and safely in
order to rise higher. This can only be, of course, if one’s
whole powers, one’s best self is put into the work. As
one cannot give to one’s labour more than one has,
every intellectual power we have attained to should
tell in our work and make itself felt. People have
said that sorrow made me a poetess. But that is not
so. Poetry is quite independent of the outer world,
of sickness or trial. I never know what I shall write
a week hence. I like to be surprised. But when an
idea takes hold of me, I do not get rid of it even
for years until it is written down. I have never had
time, and if all my ideas were not clear in my head
before I take up my pen, they would never see the
light.”</p>

<p>The Princess has called the little volume in which
she has rendered the treasures of National Roumanian
poetry in German “Roumanian Poetry,” and has thus
introduced it to her Fatherland. A collection of the
poems of O. Alecsandri, Bolintenu, Candianu, Popescu,
Cretzanu, Eminescu, Konaki, Negruzzi, Scherbanescu,
and Torceanu are here rendered in their own metre, and
treated in a manner which brings out the characteristics
of each poet.</p>

<p>“I did not think of publishing my translations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
Roumanian poetry when I wrote them. It was Frau
Mite Kremnitz who took them from me by force years
after. They appeared in a paper under the pseudonym
of E. Wedi, and later, in 1878, also in the magazine of
Foreign Literature. Still I cannot get over the dreadful
feeling of being dragged before the world even under
the disguise of E. Wedi. That is the only thing that
spoils my pleasure.”</p>

<p>A ballad, “Virful cu Dor” (The Heights of Longing),
was set to music in 1876, and was performed on
the stage of the National Theatre at Bucharest, and
afterwards at various other places. The Queen wrote
to her mother from Sinaia in September 1875:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have written a libretto from the old legend of
“Virful cu Dor,” for which Lubitz has composed the
music. It is a little ballad, which is very effective with
its choruses, solos, and duets, and it could be represented
with <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tableaux vivants</i> as well. It gives the songs of
the Spirits of the Mists in the third canto&mdash;the rushing
of wind announces the coming of Spring. The
trees and the brooks awake from their slumbers.
Yesterday we finished arranging the “Song of the
Wind” for a bass voice, and it is so poetical that the
poem is placed in a new light. I write the words out
for you, as they are a poem by themselves. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>

<p>Whilst still a Princess, Carmen Sylva had written a
French comedy, “Revenans et Revenus,” for the society
of Bucharest. She also put down many very deep and
often very philosophical aphorisms in French at that time.
These were not intended for publication at first. When
the Queen was induced to put these pages in the hands
of Herr Ulbach she hesitated at first. But he kept
looking up at her whilst he was reading and repeated&mdash;“Oh!
mais c’est très fort, mais c’est vraiment très fort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
celá!” and begged for a copy. Later they were published
at Paris with the title “Pensées d’une Reine,”
with an introduction by Ulbach. In the spring of
1888 a new, improved, and enlarged edition was published
there, to which the Academy accorded a prize.
This consists of a gold, a silver, and a bronze coin which
bear the title of the work thus crowned, “Les Pensées
d’une Reine,” with the date of 1888. They contain
rich treasures of deep thought, as for <span class="locked">instance&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Les comètes et les grands hommes laissent une
trainée de lumière dans laquelle s’agite une foule
d’atômes.”</p>

<p>“Beaucoup de gens ne critiquent que pour ne pas
paraître ignorans. Ils ignorent que l’indulgence est la
marque de la plus haute culture.”</p>

<p>“La souffrance est une lourde charrue, conduite par
une main de fer. Plus le sol est ingrat et rebelle, plus
elle le déchire, plus il est riche, plus elle s’enfonce.”</p>

<p>“La nuit tout est de feu, les étoiles, les pensées et les
larmes.”</p>

<p>On an occasion in Bucharest during which there was
a display of fireworks, this aphorism suddenly appeared
in letters of flame, to the great surprise of the Queen.</p>

<p>In years of deep sorrow the first chapters of “The
Pilgrimage of Sorrow,” “Sappho,” “Hammerstein,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
“Over the Waters,” and “Shipwreck” appeared. The
four last mentioned poems were published together, and
called “Storms.” Carmen Sylva dedicates this work
“To the unseen heroism of women,” with the following

<p>“I was much hurried whilst writing ‘Hammerstein’
and ‘Sappho,’ for I always thought that death would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
overtake me before their completion. I wrote ‘Sappho’
because I was angry with Grillparzer, for I thought
that a noble and elevated feeling should act upon so
grand a character as that of Sappho. Instead of making
a noble and elevated character out of this struggling
and suffering woman, the poet thought he had a right
to desecrate her. It seemed to me unworthy of her
to throw herself into the sea because she had been
deceived. It was more natural and poetical to sacrifice
herself for her child. It is characteristic of me that
I cannot regard what is termed ‘Love’ as the motive
power of all actions.</p>

<p>“Sappho lived in Sicily, surrounded by young girls,
to whom she taught the art of poetry. I have amused
myself in making portraits of my maids of honour.”</p>

<p>Carmen Sylva read the poem, in which she had
depicted the sad trials of the life of Sappho, to the young
friends around her.</p>

circumstance hastens her end. The death of her

<p>The poetic narrative ends with this poem.</p>

<p>The story of Hammerstein lies in Germany, in the
Middle Ages, during the war between Henry IV. and
his son Henry.</p>

<p>Since her earliest youth the Queen had carried
about with her the idea of a poem about Hammerstein.
“Many hours,” she writes, “have I spent dreaming
amongst the ruins and gazing over the Rhine. Then
I seem to hear the old Kaiser knocking at the door,
and see the gloomy Count who cursed his beautiful
daughters.” Some lovely songs, such as the following,
for instance, are interwoven in the <span class="locked">narrative:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“To publish my own writings,” says the Queen,
“would never have entered into my head, had they
not passed from one to another and been copied endlessly.
So I came to the conclusion at last that if they
are worth such tedious work as copying, they were
worthy of being printed. Whether my writings are
praised or criticised in the world is of as little moment
to me as if it did not concern myself. But when I
read my poems to others, I am pleased if they produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
the impression I desire. This is also a very safe
criterion as to their truth and clearness. I should be
delighted if my poems were sung without any one
knowing whose composition they are.”</p>

<p>The Queen now made up her mind to give way to
the entreaties of those around her, and to let her poems
“Sappho” and “Hammerstein” be privately printed.
In 1882 “The Enchantress” appeared, to which a
statue of Carl Caner had inspired her. “My fundamental
idea,” writes the Queen, “is that purity overcomes
passion or the demon, but it costs her her life.
It is death to fight against the forces of nature!” The
poetess, with her rich fancy, has made the statue seem
alive.</p>

<p>Dämona, the enchantress, is gifted with a beauty
which kills and destroys. A youth beholds her suddenly
as she appears on a lonely height, and falls desperately
in love with her. Lightning flashes from her
shining golden hair, but the idea of being loved by an
innocent being charms her fancy. The hunter has
tracked her to her winter palace of ice by the sea. She
is overcome by his passionate love for her, and sinks
into his arms. At that moment the icy building gives way
and falls to pieces, and they are buried in the deep.</p>

<p>In “Jehovah” Carmen Sylva has endeavoured to
represent the doubt, Does God exist or not? which is
for ever struggling in the mind of man. Ahasuerus
desires to trace all things to their origin. He regards
eternal life as a curse. His vocation is accomplished if
he can attain to knowledge.</p>

<p>He seeks God in art, in his own restless activity,
in the passion of love, in the desire of possession, &amp;c.
But everywhere the answer comes, “God is not here.”
At last he realises God in the eternal laws of nature.
Then death comes and releases the believer.</p>

<p>“Jehovah” was translated into French verse in 1887
by Hélène Vacaresco, a youthful poetess.</p>

<p>“The Pilgrimage of Sorrow,” a cycle of fairy tales,
also appeared in 1882. The poetic fancy of Carmen
Sylva has here treated the question, “Whence and for
what reason do sorrow and suffering come?” symbolically,
and placed it in fairy tales. “To live is to suffer,
but two faithful comforters remain at your side during
the fight and help you to endure. They are termed
Patience and Labour.” This is the leading idea of
this poem. The royal lady possesses a wonderful
power of representing the deepest feelings of the heart,
which only those can do who have gone through all
phases of suffering. She has a fellow-feeling for all
who strive and struggle, and can realise and deeply
sympathise with the sufferings of humanity.</p>

Tales of the Pelesch,” she wrote the following poem in
her <span class="locked">journal:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Through the Centuries” is the name of the second
volume of “From Carmen Sylva’s Kingdom” (1887).
They are fairy tales and ballads told in prose, and
taken from the Roumanian national poetry. “They are
history, legends, ballads, and novels (but all true ones)
together,” writes the Queen. “It begins with the fall
of Decebal, and ends with the taking of Widdin.”</p>

<p>Heroes and heroic deeds are here brought before us
in disconnected tales. We read of the fall of the Datian
Prince Decebal, of times when the Roman influence
was also felt in Roumania, which still lives among
the Roumanian people in songs and traditions. We
gaze into the Middle Ages and hear of Stephen the
Great, as well as the Legend of Manole, the architect
of the Cathedral of Curtea de Arges, which is told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
with such marvellous simplicity, and others. We
meet with figures of heroic women, such as the
Mother of Stephen the Great, Decebal’s daughter,
Andrada, Fausta, Neaga. The ballads also describe
later episodes, which, being on elevating or touching
subjects, have been taken up by the people.</p>

<p>“When I let all my characters die,” writes the
Queen, “I am only like nature, in which everything
ends with death. There is nothing in this world
which has any other ending than death. It is such
a peaceful feeling when they have ceased to struggle,
and the poor soul is at rest. Decebal’s end is as
historically true as most histories.</p>

<p>“The third volume will contain legends of birds
or flowers, amongst which ‘Jochen Spatz’ belongs
to Roumania. I was asked to write a page in the
album which is dedicated to the memory of Fritz
Reuter, and sent this fairy tale of the people.”</p>

<p>Later the royal lady composed a highly poetical
libretto for the opera. It treats of an episode in
the life of the Roumanian people, and is called Neaga.
The Swedish composer Hallström has set it to music.
The subject of the poem, “A Prayer,” was also taken
from life, having occurred to a priest.</p>

<p>The Queen writes French poetry with ease. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
the spring of 1883 the “Félibres,” an alliance of
authors and learned men in the South of France which
had in view the resuscitation of Provence and its
poetry, induced the Queen to answer in the same
strain. The royal pair were spending a few weeks
at Sestri Ponente at that time. Thither the Félibres
de Lar sent her Majesty a sonnet in the old language
of Provence, containing the poetic invitation to visit
them in the sunny land of the Troubadours. Without
much reflection Queen Elizabeth answered them
in the following poem, which we give here as a proof
of the wide range of her <span class="locked">talent:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>We will also mention the two newest works of
Carmen Sylva that were published at Christmas 1883.
First we will tell of a little book of novelettes, termed
“Etchings.” It contains sketches and pictures from life,
which bear the technical titles of the work of the
artist, such as Engravings, Chalk Drawings, Wood Engravings,
&amp;c. “In my eyes,” says the royal lady,
“novelettes are for the poet what studies of heads are
for the artist, and the aphorisms are the slight sketches
in the sketch-book.” Almost at the same time the
large collection of poems termed ‘My Rest’ appeared.</p>

<p>Amongst them are poetic idylls reverting to the
twelve months of the year. A collection of poems
belong to each of these, some of which are written in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
the form of epic poems or romances, others in lyric,
epigrammatic, or didactic form. Most of the ballads
are taken from life. In these forms the poetic genius
and intellectual power of Carmen Sylva appear to their
greatest advantage, and we find many cheerful songs
in this rich collection. “The Post,” a Roumanian
picture, vivid with life and colour, is particularly charming.
It runs <span class="locked">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In the second edition “My Rest” appeared in
small single volumes, <i>i.e.</i>&mdash;1. “Heights and Depths;”
2. “Worldly Wisdom;” 3. “Mother and Child;”
4. “Ballads and Romances.”</p>

<p>“My Rhine” was new poetry. Under this title
Carmen Sylva brought out in 1884 a poetical description
of the towns and castles of her native Rhine.
Artistic illustrations and etchings of the landscapes
adorn each poem.</p>

<p>“It Knocks.” “Between whiles I have written a
little novel of 100 pages,” writes the Queen, “because
a poor boy came to beg me to give his father some
editing to do. They were so badly off, he said, and
he wished to surprise his parents with a manuscript
of mine. I think it is the best thing I have written,
all the more as it is quite true, and I have only created<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
the framework. If one is not too discreet, real life
offers more than the creatures of one’s imagination.</p>

<p>“I do not think it makes a difference in the work
if the <i>donnée</i> is true or not. All is true which is
true inwardly, for all has happened, and the novelist
has only to disentangle the thread and show why it
has happened. It is tremendously hard work for body
and mind.”</p>

<p>“My Book.” An Egyptian picture-book with drawings
from Egypt round the borders, and facsimile poems
of Carmen Sylva (1885).</p>

<p>“From Two Worlds.” A novel by Carmen Sylva,
written in joint authorship with Frau Mite Kemnitz,
<i>née</i> Bardeleben, and brought out in 1885 under the
pseudonym of “Ditto” and “Idem.” In the form of
letters and journals a love story is here developed
between two persons of different social standing. The
young Princess Ulrike von Grosreichenstein takes a
fancy to a Professor of History in Greifswald, whose
principal work she has read. She writes to him of
her passionate admiration. The correspondence leads
to a personal meeting and deep love. Thereupon
follows a scene, a love match, a terrible catastrophe,
and at last the noble family, so proud of its descent,
is conciliated to the unalterable facts. It is not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
description of real life, but the different manner of
thinking and looking at things, in which the interest
of “In Two Worlds” is centred. The letters of Princess
Ulrike are by “Ditto” (Carmen Sylva), while “Idem”
(Mite Kremnitz) originated the Professor.</p>

<p>“Astra,” a novel by Ditto and Idem (1886). The
places described in this novel are in the immediate
neighbourhood of Roumania. The habits of the people
and the country are here described with great exactness
and in a lively manner. Astra goes on a visit
to her sister, who is married to a country gentleman
of the province of Bukowina. Sandor becomes enamoured
of the “Will o’ the Wisp,” his graceful sister-in-law.
This leads to a conflict which ends tragically.
Here also the epistolary form is chosen. While the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dramatis personæ</i> let us see the innermost thoughts
of their hearts, the development of their characters
is clearly unfolded. Carmen Sylva gave the following
answer to some ladies who had written to inquire
if the unhappy being depicted in Astra had really
lived, and whether the novel was based on truth.</p>

<p>“<i>21st July 1836.</i>&mdash;A good novel must, according
to my convictions, never be anything but an imaginary
biography. You have only to put together the contrasts
of which every life really consists. You would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
hardly believe of how many thousands of prisms a
human being is made up. He is a regular kaleidoscope.
As you turn him, he assumes a different aspect.
The motive power of the experience and impressions
is the principal thing. Words spring out of this of
themselves.</p>

<p>“Astra is perhaps a vague recollection of a charming
creature whom I always called my Will o’ the Wisp, and
who to my eternal sorrow had the same fate as them all,
though this is not in any way like the little Astra.
Margot is the creation of my fellow-worker, Frau Mite
Kremnitz, who had the death-scenes plainly before
her mind, though every one was against it. As to
Sandor, we are afraid that he really exists, though,
of course, he is not quite the same. We may not
be so indiscreet as to paint portraits, but the brain
is too good a photographic plate not to take hold of
what we have experienced and to reproduce it to a
certain extent, whilst we are thinking that we are
working from imagination alone.</p>

<p>“Our working together is certainly charming. What
talks and what sharp encounters we have when we
separate of an evening, and during the night a new
solution has appeared to every one. This then must
be the right one! Still we surprise one another in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
its execution. Our first book was called ‘From Two
Worlds.’ Since ‘Astra’ we have written a novel, ‘It
was a Mistake.’ It appeared in 1886, first in “Nord
und Süd,” when we often took the pen out of each
other’s hands and let the other write on.</p>

<p>“There is another book in print, ‘The Century,’
which is very good. It is a novel by Ditto and
Idem, describing the time of the French War of 1870.
We have already a new book on the brain which
is to be called “Brother and Sister,” and to which
we look forward with the joy of children, and whose
tragical moments we dread already, before the first
word is written, for we must pay dearly for it when
we dive into the depths of the heart. We cannot
do this without suffering great pain. And with what
anxiety does one ask oneself at every line, ‘Is that
true?’ As if one stood before a judge and bore
a tremendous responsibility! For nothing can give
authors more pleasure than that that which comes
from the heart should touch the hearts of others.
A book of 300 pages has already lain by for four
years, because I have not the courage to bear all the
trials which my characters have to suffer, and yet I
cannot but write what I know to be true.”</p>

<p>“Mistaken”&mdash;tales of Ditto and Idem of which most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
of the circumstances were taken from life. Amongst
other things the story of the funeral during the
snowstorm is most touching. The pathetic and yet
so simple a story of love and death, as well as the
description of the terrible storm, are here recounted
with marvellous artistic power.</p>

<p>“Seventeen Songs of the Artisans,” by J.&nbsp;E. Bowen,
were translated into English, and appeared in the Prize
Number of the <i>Independent</i> in New York in 1887.
There they will also appear as a small book.</p>

<p>“The Fishers of Iceland,” by Pierre Loti, translated
into German by Carmen Sylva. From a letter of the
Queen, 5th September 1887:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I should like to do all I can to bring the two nations together,
and make use of everything and everybody for that
purpose, for I have a sort of fixed idea that the Germanic
and Latin races should complete one another. I am now
doing something that is to further this object: I am translating
the most beautiful book of modern times, ‘Les
Pêcheurs d’Islande,’ by Pierre Loti, into German. This is
quite a new sort of work, which gives me infinite pleasure.
It seems to flow from my pen. I began it on the 26th
of August, and hope to have finished it in five days, for
I have already translated two hundred sheets, and have
only one hundred more to do. It is so wonderfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
beautiful that I rejoice or weep during my work, and
enjoy every sentence. It is an epic poem in prose,
simple, grand, and true. In translating I enjoy the
pleasure of producing something, and feel no despair,
only pleasure. How wonderfully beautiful this book is!
I feel as if I had made great progress by reading Pierre
Loti. A good book is better for one than the most
severe criticisms, for one can see for oneself what is
beautiful and what is badly written.</p>

<p>“The fishers of Iceland are a part of the people of
the coast of Bretagne who have fished in the Arctic Seas
for generations. This dangerous but remunerative business
descends from father to son. It demands great
sacrifices from the ranks of the Bretagne fishermen year
by year. The heroes of the novel, as well as the other
characters, are all types of people, strong and natural
characters, which are not spoilt by the disturbing influences
of civilisation. With the eyes of an artist Pierre
Loti has observed the natural phenomena and the changing
lights of those northern regions, and has represented
them to us with the soul of an artist.”</p>

<p>The Queen has translated this book with the same
feelings as though it were her own creation. The descriptions
of nature, the storm on the sea, the simple
life of a fisherman, each separate picture in miniature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
is rendered word for word in the short and precise style
of Pierre Loti. The touching story reads like a German
poem. Carmen Sylva has artistically accomplished the
task of giving the individuality of the author with a
breath of his feelings in another language.</p>

<p class="title"><i>To Augustus Bungert.</i></p>

<p>“I am always being preached at to keep quiet and cool
while I am at work, but this is of no use&mdash;the fury
is there! The next day I look upon what is finished
so coldly, and as if it were the greatest horror, whilst
I cannot take my eyes off when I am at work. If only
each work were not a piece of one’s life, as Daudet so
beautifully describes it in ‘L’homme a la cervelle d’or,’
in the ‘Lettres de mon moulin.’”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Two fairy tales are in preparation, “The Labours of
the Pelesch,” a sort of allegory; “The Strange Adventures
of the Gipsy Didica;” and “Songs of the Artisans.”</p>

<p>From letters of the Queen to Augustus Bungert, 18th
February 1888:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘The Songs of the Artisans’ are a splendid work
for me. I have the idea, and call the whole story
‘Waldvogel’s Songs,’ while the fairy tale of Prince
Waldvogel, which I have had in my head for years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
appears at the same time, as if he had sung all the
songs. It must be brought down to modern times, or I
shall not be up to the Artisans. It will be called ‘Love
Songs of the Artisans in Wood and Field.’ One hundred
and thirty songs are already composed, and there
are about twenty more to arrange. But the electric
current is broken sometimes, and I do not so easily find
it again. If I can keep to my work, one thought leads
to another, and I cannot write them down as fast as they
come. But the object of laying by what is written is
that what is not good is eradicated later. But I should
be able to talk over all these things, for I have no judgment
as to what is good or bad. What is gone is gone!
When I have painted something I turn its face to the
wall so as not to see it again. I never open what is
once printed, but go on, and on.</p>

<p>“This winter I have also made a plot for a tragedy,
‘Meister Manole.’ But I want a quiet time to write it
in. I have also a long poem, ‘Nemesis,’ in my head,
and the beginning of four novels. But what appears
to me the best does not strike others so. It is lucky
that amongst ten persons each one thinks a different
poem the best.</p>

<p>“As to the great poem which I have still to write,
I often have the feeling that it will come one day, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
not by doing nothing. A day of rest is nearly a misfortune
to me. I have at once the feeling of being
unable to work. It is quite childish! I feel as if I
were drifting into the sea, into infinite space in deepest
melancholy, and could not find any firm footing! Just
try how you feel when you have not written anything
for two days. Certainly I have not yet composed a
Nausikaa, and cannot rest on my laurels, but am constantly
incited by the feeling of not having done anything
yet.”</p>

<p>Most of the works of the Queen are already translated
into various languages, or are being translated.
Many of her poems have also been set to music.</p>

<p>Augustus Bungert, the poet and composer of Tetralogy,
the World of Homer, Nausikaa, the Return of Odysseus,
&amp;c., has edited the finest poems from “The Witch,” “My
Rest,” and “Songs of the Artisans,” and called them
“Poems of a Queen;” as well as “My Rhine,” “Dramas
in Songs,” “Kalafat,” &amp;c. Hallström, Reinecke, Gounod,
and Madame Augusta Holmès in Paris have arranged
Carmen Sylva’s poems as songs.</p>

working imagination of the royal poetess will have

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> conclusion, let us allow the last years of
the life of the Queen to unroll themselves
before us.</p>

<p>Her strength had been overtaxed by the
physical and moral strain imposed upon her during the
time of war, and constantly recurring attacks of fever
had weakened her. Early in the year 1882 the Queen
was attacked by severe illness.</p>

<p>For many weeks the royal lady was hanging between
life and death. The whole nation was full of
anxiety and sympathy, and the love of her people
and the popularity her Majesty enjoyed was displayed
in a touching manner during this time. Poor women
even, who had to work hard for their daily bread,
gave their little savings to the Church in order to
have a prayer said for the preservation of their beloved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
“Muma Regina.” The Queen bore her dreadful
sufferings heroically, and her patience, gentleness, and
solicitude for her attendants were beautiful to witness.
She always had a comforting and hopeful word for
the King, who scarcely left her bedside. The life
of the Queen was saved by a successful operation,
and six weeks after she was once more standing at
her easel and illuminating on parchment.</p>

<p>But though restored to health, her Majesty was
more than ever subject to the pernicious influence
of the climate, and the attacks of fever returned in
shorter intervals. Only a change of air could be of
any avail, but circumstances prevented the Queen
leaving the country. At last, in the spring of 1883,
the King could accompany his consort to Italy. In
Sestri Ponente, on the Mediterranean, the Queen soon
so far recovered that she could travel to Neuwied and
Segenhaus to complete her cure there. The Dowager
Princess of Wied had been seriously ill at the same
time. With what deep feelings mother and daughter
met at last can easily be imagined!</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth spent nine weeks at the Segenhaus,
where her native air restored her youthful freshness
and activity, and she could give herself up entirely
to the happiness of being again surrounded by her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
nearest relations. These were, according to her expression,
days that had wings and were without a
cloud. During her presence the little castle on the
heights of the Westerwald became a second Belriguardo.
One imagined oneself transported back to the time of
the Medicis. Here distinguished relations, artists and
learned men, went in and out, and often remained for
days and weeks at Monrepos and Segenhaus. Alexandri,
the Roumanian poet, brought his new drama to read
and discuss with the Queen. Hallström, the Swedish
composer, wished to lay before her Majesty that part
of the opera “Neaga” which he had finished composing.
The artist, Augustus Becker, came from Düsseldorf
with his Roumanian sketches, after which he was
going to paint a large picture by the King’s order.
Karl Cauer, from Kreuznach, had made a bust of the
Queen, and wished to compare it with the original.
In the studio at Monrepos, Prince William and the
Dutch artist, Bisschop, were painting a portrait of the
Queen. On his way back to Oxford, Professor Max
Müller remained at the Segenhaus for some days.
Intercourse with this man of deep thought and learning
elevates one into the refined and intellectual atmosphere
in which he lives and thinks.</p>

<p>The Musical Festival of the Rhenish Provinces was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
to be held at Cologne during this year. The Queen
wished to be present at it. Since that important day
in which she and Prince Charles of Roumania had been
betrothed, she had not again seen the beautiful town
on the Rhine. Now the great creations of sound resounded
in her ears, and the recollections of past days
were mightily awakened. The words of the following
song are so fresh, that it is as if, after sixteen years
of married life, bridal affection were still new to her
heart.</p>

<p>Wonderfully beautiful were their wanderings through
the beechwoods, the mild summer evenings spent on
the balcony of the castle, with its view over the
landscape glowing in the rich colours of sunset. Every
bright idea was turned into a poem or a song, and
every deep thought was put down in writing. The
hours during which the Queen, either in the castle
or under the forest trees, read her poetry aloud to us,
will ever dwell in our memory. She is a perfect
mistress of the art of reading aloud, and the sweet
tones of her melodious voice heightened the effect
of the dramatic situations and the deep feelings which
she so graphically describes. Those who had the high
privilege of sharing the great interest of these weeks
can understand the charm which the so richly endowed
nature of the Queen exercises on all who are permitted
to come near her. This time spent in the Segenhaus
was living poetry!</p>

<p>When Queen Elizabeth returned to her country and
settled at Sinaia for the hot summer months, the royal
pair lived in the romantic old monastery for the last
time. The building of Castle Pelesch was nearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
its completion, and a railway now formed a communication
between Bucharest and Sinaia. Life and
activity now reigned in the once quiet valley of Prahova,
for, following the example of their King, the Roumanian
nobles built themselves fine country houses on the slopes
of hills and in the shade of the forest. By degrees
the little town of Sinaia arose, whose arrangements
now meet all the requirements of a modern watering-place.</p>

<p>The royal castle, which is built in the style of German
renaissance, arises, surrounded by the forest, in a gorge
at the foot of the Caraiman mountain. This many-sided
building, with its arched galleries and balconies, is surmounted
by numerous gables, towers, and turrets. The
inner building and arrangements of the castle are also
very practical, and the perfect artistic taste which reigns
is visible in every nook and cranny. Nothing is overdone,
though all is carried out in quite magnificent style.
The walls of the grand staircase are richly painted, and
the panels of the inner apartments are sumptuously
adorned with bronzes and gobelin tapestry.</p>

<p>All the windows of this large building are enriched
with painted glass, through which alone the light of day
penetrates into the wonderful harmony of these apartments.
The glass paintings in the music room represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
scenes from Roumanian legends which have been
immortalised by the poet Alexandri. On the walls are
paintings representing Carmen Sylva’s “Cycle of Fairy
Tales,” whilst scenes from the Life of a Knight adorn the
dining-hall. The smoking-room in the principal tower,
arranged in old German style, is very cosy. But the
greatest success is the Queen’s studio, from the covered
balconies of which one gazes into the deep forests which
cover the mountains. The poetical impression of the
castle is heightened when, with the twilight, electric light
radiates from the inside of the beautiful building, and
lights up its lofty chambers from outside, whilst the
crystal drops of the little lamps follow the lines of the
architecture and make them bright. This castle also
is a poem which the royal pair have carried out together
in sweet concord.</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<span class="iq">“I, King Charles, have raised here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the people that trusted and held me dear,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In the time of peace my home, my star.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>On the 7th of October 1883 Castle Pelesch was
solemnly consecrated in the presence of the highest
officials of the country.</p>

<p>After the documents which the Queen had painted
had been signed, the Metropolitan blessed the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
brought to him whilst the choir sang. Then the procession
started and passed through the courtyard, thickly
strewn with the branches of fir, from which the scent
of the forest was wafted at every tread to the castle.
The keys were solemnly handed over to the King before
the beautifully carved hall door.</p>

<p>His Majesty threw it open, and the Metropolitan first
crossed the threshold of the house. Followed by the
royal pair and the long procession of guests, and accompanied
by songs of praise and prayer, he walked through
all the rooms. Whilst scattering drops of holy water
about them, he consecrated the house and prayed for the
blessing of God.</p>

<p>When the King had brought out a toast to Roumania
at the banquet which followed, he added these words&mdash;“Confident
in the possession of the love of my people,
I have here erected a house of my own. It shall stand
as a lasting proof of the firm footing which my dynasty
has attained in this country. The Roumanian people
are to see herein a monument of the unlimited confidence
with which I look forward to the future of our beloved
fatherland.”</p>

<p>In the name of the Roumanian nation Alexandri
brought out the congratulations of the people with the
verse with which in ancient times the peasants had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
celebrated the entrance into the new home of their
princes and nobles.</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<span class="iq">“As many stones and beams,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The sun shall warm it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the winds strengthen it.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“May the blessing of God and the love of the people
forever dwell within the walls of this house.”</p>

<p>The blessing of the poet has come true! The progress
made by the State, which is developing in all
respects, and is full of life and power, are remarkable.
The King has appointed a sum from his privy purse
for a Lexicon of the Academy, which is to be a
standard of the language to be employed in writing.
In thousands of schools the lectures in Roumanian
are held free of charge. The King has also founded
a Geographical Society. A longing for culture, for
the furthering of the national interest, has taken hold
of all classes of the Roumanian people. A net of
railways overspreads the country, an active commerce
binds Roumania to the rest of Europe, and a mighty
army stands in readiness to protect the native hearth.
At the glorious storming of the Grivitza fort of Plevna
the youthful army first showed its powers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
On the 11th of September 1877 the Roumanians
had, exposed to a heavy artillery fire, three times endeavoured
in vain to take the fortifications of Grivitza.
They were always thrown back by the courageous
stand their enemies made. The battlefield was covered
with the dead and wounded. Then Prince Carol
galloped up to his troops, shouting, “Forward to
victory, my children.” Inspired by the presence and
the voice of their heroic leader, the brave men of
the second battalion of Chasseurs again stormed the
Turkish bulwarks, and before the evening came on
the Roumanian flag waved on the fort of Grivitza!
Nearly all the officers, and half of the men, had bought
the victory with their life.</p>

<p>In the East the number seven is a sacred number.
Therefore the seventh anniversary of this memorable
day, the 11th of September 1884, was to be celebrated
with peculiar solemnity at Sinaia.</p>

<p>The bells of the monastery chapel were tolling.
Round about the courtyard of the monastery stood
the second battalion of Chasseurs eagerly awaiting the
arrival of the royal pair, who were descending from
the castle to the cloister attended by a large suite.
The flag of Roumania, adorned with its star, and torn
to shreds in the battles, was lowered upon the entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
of the royal pair, who now entered the church. Within
resounded a solemn mass for the fallen and a song
of praise for the victory won. Without, in the court
of the monastery, the military band played the poem
written by Th. Körner, and composed by Hummel&mdash;“Father
I call to Thee.” On undertaking the government
the King had chosen this as the prayer of the
army, and since then it is regularly played on great
occasions.</p>

<p>At the close of the service the troops defiled before
the King. Then they marched in a long procession
through the splendid beech and fir woods to a height
which commanded a view over the whole valley. There
the camp of tents was erected. Before a triumphal
arch the Mayor presented the Queen with a bouquet
of roses in the name of the battalion of Chasseurs,
and to the sound of the National Hymn the royal
pair proceeded to the middle of the camp. Here
stood two tents, one arranged for the royal banquet,
the other for the soldiers. The royal tent was decorated
with the innate taste of the Roumanians for
the beautiful. From the outside only green branches
and ferns were to be seen, amidst which the entwined
initials of the royal pair appeared. Within, the tent
was ornamented with some of the Queen’s mottoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
which related to a soldier’s life and heroic deeds,
and which the officers had translated into Roumanian.
There were also verses by the poet Alexandri, who
had written them when the people were under arms.
Amongst them appeared the names of the Roumanians
who had fallen whilst storming the fort of Grivitza.
Martial music was played during the repast, and a
crowd of people in the beautiful costume of the country
surrounded the tents. At a given signal the joyous
strains ceased, and the soldiers stood before the tent of
their King.</p>

<p>Amidst perfect silence, and in a voice which was
heard from far, the King harangued his Chasseurs as to
the meaning and the fame of this ever-memorable day,
and ended with the <span class="locked">words&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Hold fast the sacred tradition of 1877, so as
always to be worthy of the great distinctions which
you owe to your brave brothers in arms. I raise my
glass to drink to the health of the army, and to the
memory of the fallen heroes of Grivitza.” Enthusiastic
hurrahs and the braying of trumpets awoke the echoes
of the hills. Then the King rose again to wreathe
the flag in the name of the Queen, and said&mdash;“This
garland of flowers the Queen dedicates to the flag
torn with bullets and blackened with the smoke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
the powder, around which the remnants of the battalion
crowded in the hour of danger and pressed on to
victory!”</p>

<p>The banquet had ended. The King surrounded by
his soldiers, and the Queen by children, went from
tent to tent, giving all a kind word or a smile. Then
gipsy music suddenly resounded, and as if by magic
the crowd arranged itself hand in hand for the famous
dance of the Hora, this celebrated national dance of
the Roumanians. The royal pair placed themselves
in the middle of the circle formed by soldiers, peasants,
and ladies and gentlemen. It was soon extended to
such a length that a second circle of dancing children
formed itself round the Queen. At first the Hora
moved slowly and with stately grace, but when the
gipsies sang the Kindia, when the violins, pipes, mandolins,
and tambourines sounded louder and quicker,
the circle was broken, and the people flew up and
down in long rows. They surged to the right and
to the left, backwards and forwards, without pausing,
and with breathless speed. They were all in the
highest spirits, but their joy was kept within bounds.
There was no disorder, and only joyous sounds resounded
in the hills.</p>

<p>At sunset the royal pair returned to the castle. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
thousand voices cheered them as they descended the
height, and sounded on and on when their figures
had long been lost in the gloom of the forest. Soon
the braying of trumpets was heard in the still side
valley of the Prahova, where the beautiful castle of
the King stands near the foaming Pelesch. One torch
after another appeared in the dark fir woods. Then
the procession of torches came up the sides of the
hill and stood before the castle, which, being at this
moment illuminated with Bengal lights, shone like
a fairy palace in the dark night, the royal pair appearing
in the glorious light. The military bands sounded
grand amongst those mighty mountains. The performance
of the battle prayer was the close of this
patriotic fête. The torch-bearers gradually disappeared
into the shades of the forest. Deep silence surrounded
the castle, and broad shadows overspread the forest
and mountains. Night stretched her dreamy wings,
over the landscape which had so lately been peopled
by a gay throng.</p>

<p>A few weeks later the royal pair left their castle
in the Carpathians and travelled to Sigmaringen.
Prince Charles Anthony of Hohenzollern and his consort,
born a Princess of Baden, the parents of the King
of Roumania, celebrated their golden wedding there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
on the 21st of October. All their children and
grandchildren surrounded the venerable pair. The
Emperor William heightened the brilliancy of this
extraordinary festivity by his presence, to which nearly
all the Princes of Germany had assembled themselves
in the castle of the Hohenzollern. Numerous deputations
brought artistically executed congratulatory addresses,
presents, and poems. They were all tokens
of sincere and grateful veneration, for the whole of
Germany had taken a lively interest in the happiness
of the princely pair.</p>

<p>But to this joy soon succeeded the sorrow at the
death of Prince Charles Anthony of Hohenzollern.
After much suffering a sort of apoplectic fit had
seized him. His condition became worse, his weakness
increased, and he lost consciousness. Surrounded
by his children and the faithful partner of his life, he
passed away on the 2nd of June 1885, without a
struggle. During the sad days when the Prince
was slowly dying, the Queen of Roumania had been
“a true angel of consolation,” as she expressed it, to
her mother-in-law, the now widowed Princess Josephine.
Queen Elizabeth had watched and prayed with
her at the deathbed of the Prince during the first
night, and had undertaken for her the numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
labours of love which in such days have such claims
on heart and time.</p>

<p>It was a historic moment when, on the morning of
the 6th of June, the mourning procession, headed by
the then Crown Prince of the German Empire, started
from the castle to the tomb of their ancestors, in
which the mortal remains of the last reigning Prince
of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen were laid to rest. He
belonged to the most distinguished and meritorious
men of his time, whose influence the grateful German
Fatherland will not forget.</p>

<p>But not alone the family lost a beloved centre in
the noble German Prince. The Emperor William bewailed
in him the trusted friend of many years, who
had stood faithfully at his side in times of difficulty and
danger. Prince Charles Anthony had made the first
step towards the union of Germany. Having realised
with great political insight during the occurrences of
1848 that the position of the little states was untenable,
he willingly renounced the sovereignty of his
Hohenzollern lands. He handed his principality over
to the head of the Prussian branch of his house,
and forthwith, as the first German subject, worked
with great unselfishness and conscientiousness to help
on the power and greatness of Germany. Prussia’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
territory now extended to the south of Germany. As
a memento of this deed, Frederick William IV. founded
the Order of Hohenzollern, with the inscription, “Vom
Fels zum Meer” (From the Rock to the Sea).</p>

<p>The Roumanians also bewailed the loss of this noble
Prince. They knew that he had followed the development
of the country with the interest of a statesman,
for its fate remains closely bound up in the family of
Hohenzollern. Roumania is an hereditary constitutional
monarchy. In the year 1866 the naturalisation
of the Sigmaringen branch of the Hohenzollerns was
carried out, and the question of the succession legally
settled. Prince Leopold, the then hereditary Prince,
stood nearest to the throne, and his second son Ferdinand
was the heir-apparent of King Charles.</p>

<p>In 1886 this circumstance assumed a political
significance. During a visit of the present Prince
Leopold and his two sons, Ferdinand and Charles, a
weighty affair of State was transacted. The King had
nominated Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern chief of
the 3rd Regiment of Grenadiers, which Prince Ferdinand
now entered as a lieutenant. After his nomination
had been read out in the presence of the Queen,
all the Ministers, the Presidents of the Senate and
Chamber of Deputies, as well as all the generals and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
officers, the King addressed the assembly. Touching
on the entrance of Prince Ferdinand into the Roumanian
army, he <span class="locked">added&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“This is an honour for him of which I am assured
he will prove himself worthy. For us it is a great
cause for rejoicing and a surety for the future which the
country will understand, for as a member of my family
he might one day be called upon to protect my kingdom
and to carry on our traditions. It is therefore
a weighty moment which now unites us here, and in
later times we shall often remember that the 26th
of November has a deep meaning. I and my successor,
to-day and in the future, will place our entire confidence
in the army and rest on its sure foundations.”</p>

<p>Loud hurrahs often interrupted the royal speech,
and the touching and important ceremony was brought
to a close by the march-past of the troops, during which
the Prince of Hohenzollern led his regiment, and Prince
Ferdinand with deep emotion took his place in its ranks
near the flag.</p>

<p>What feelings throbbed through the heart of the
royal lady at this moment, which brought so vividly
before her the bitterness of her sorrow, all she thus
had to resign, and how many disappointed hopes! This
great sorrow had been her constant companion during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
the last eighteen years&mdash;“It has added the battle with
itself to the battle with life.”</p>

<p>“<i>3rd March 1886.</i>&mdash;And yet I shall never say I
would rather not have lived, for my life is rich and full,
and though the waves do not cease to beat, they are
mighty waves on a deep sea, and the wind which
whistles round my cables makes them a harp and sings
songs to the world. No; life is still beautiful though
it may be stormy.”</p>

<p>What was deeply enshrined in her heart has found an
expression in songs and pictures. The Queen has quite
lately raised a monument of her lost child which will
outlive many a human life, for she has entrusted it to
the sacred keeping of the Church.</p>

<p>During the government of King Charles not only the
political and commercial life of the country was renewed,
but he had regarded it as his duty to save the treasures
of art and the ancient buildings of the country from
destruction. One of the finest monuments of the Middle
Ages, and a marvel of classical Byzantine, architecture,
is the Cathedral of Curtea de Arges. Through the influence
of the weather, fire, and neglect it had fallen
into decay. King Charles sent for the famous Lecomte
de Nouy, a scholar of Viollet-le-Duc, to Roumania, in
order to restore the church according to the intentions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
its founder, as gloriously as it stood nearly four hundred
years ago.</p>

<p>On the 5th of March 1886 Queen Elizabeth writes
to her mother:&mdash;“I have undertaken a great work for
the Church of Curtea de Arges. I am inscribing the
gospels on enormous sheets of vellum, from which they
are then to be read every Thursday as a recollection of
that Thursday on which I heard them read beside the
coffin of my child. It will be a fine work, and I shall
write this book with my own hands, so that it will be
the best monument to little Marie. I will paint a
dedication for its consecration according to the customs
of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>“The binding will be executed by Telge in Berlin
in cloisonnet after my designs. I have just painted a
background with a scarlet border. Gold letters with
red in them are to appear on this blue background,
and on the scarlet edge Moorish ornaments in gold with
blue. You can imagine how rich this will be.</p>

<p>“On the first page are four episodes in the life of
Marie, and four from the Passion of Christ, on which
the words ‘Betrayed’ might stand: ‘Gethsemane, the
Kiss of Judas, the Betrayal, and the Purple Robe.’ In
the middle is the Resurrection, that is the Noli me
tangere of Fiesole, Christ and the Magdalene. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
other side of the page is my dedication surrounded by
angels’ heads. In the midst my child’s portrait. She
is represented as tolling the Easter bell. To the left
Otto; to the right Hermann, Marie, and Franzi; in the
middle below Stéphanie; on the right Marie Bibra; to
the left Marie Sulzer. Their names and the dates of
their death are inscribed at the side.</p>

<p>“The dedication is as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘I have made this book of the Twelve<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Gospels of the
Passion of our Lord and Saviour Christ Jesus for the
Holy Church and Episcopacy of Curtea de Arges, and
consecrated it to God as a monument to my only and
deeply loved child Marie, who passed to life eternal on
Thursday in Holy Week, and at whose deathbed I then
heard the consoling words of God.</p>

<p>“<i>18th February 1888.</i>&mdash;The Book of the Gospels
of Curtea de Arges takes much strength and time.
It contains fifty large sheets of parchment, and will
want fifty more. When I am working at it my pen
is thrown aside. It is as if my fancy could only work
in one direction at a time. Of course I work at it
twelve to thirteen hours a day, and finish a page in
three days.”</p>

<p xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“Et dire que ce travail machinal me survivra peut-être
seul, quand tout ce que j’ai écrit sera démodé et
mes grandes pensées éteintes!”</p>

<p>In the middle of October 1886 the renovated basilica
was to be consecrated, and the King and Queen were to
arrive in Curtea de Arges on that day. The little
market town lies in Wallachia, to the north-west of
Pitesci, and was the seat of the Wallachian Princes
from the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries. The
cathedral stands on a height outside the little town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
It is said to have been built between 1517 and 1527
by the architect Manole. According to the legend,
Manole buried his young wife alive in the foundations
of the building, to break the spell which caused the
work of the day to fall to pieces in the night. Art
critics say that this church is unique of its kind.
The Greek cross was chosen for the plan of foundation
of the basilica, with a wide dome. The whole
building is painted green, gold, and blue. The arches
of the windows and their frames, and the numberless
garlands in stone which entwine around them, are
covered with numerous and ever-varying ornamental
sculptures. The effect of these is enhanced by a gold
ground and light tints. As symbolic ornaments, little
doves carved in stone with bells in their beaks hover over
these garlands. The most beautiful harmony of colour
and form pervades the whole of this artistically perfect
creation. Some steps lead up to the Moorish entrance,
the ante-hall of which is supported by twelve pillars.
Not far from the principal entrance stands the
baptistery.</p>

<p>When the King and Queen arrived, the road from
Pitesci to Curtea de Arges was decked with numberless
triumphal arches, but the greatest ornament were
the people, who enthusiastically greeted their Majesties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
and whose beautiful national costumes harmonised in
a wonderful manner with the architecture.</p>

<p>From a telegram from the Minister Stourdza to the
Dowager Princess of <span class="locked">Wied:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“We have in consecrating the Episcopal Church of
Arges taken part in a beautiful and ideal fête which
nothing could further enhance. Surrounded by an
indescribably beautiful landscape, which shone in a
glorious light and magnificent autumn tints, the fête
was intensified by religious, artistic, and poetical feelings,
as well as by the recollection of the past, a
sense of the present, and a firm faith in the future.
The King and Queen were the centre of interest, to
whom a crowd of all classes from all parts of the
kingdom (above 20,000 people) brought a magnificent
ovation.</p>

<p>“The speech of the King from the portal of the
church found an echo in the hearts of all present. The
book of the Gospels written by the Queen and now
consecrated was demanded by the people, and kissed
with touching devotion. This day is a day of great
importance and wide-spreading influence. We were
consecrating a splendid Temple of Peace to the God
of Heaven whilst dreadful disorders surrounded us.
All the clergy, from Archbishop to Priest, came to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
King to thank him warmly for the protection which
he had accorded to the church, and for the beacon
light which the Roumanian Church had, through the
influence of King Charles, become in the East.”</p>

<p>On the 30th of October 1886 Queen Elizabeth writes
to her mother:&mdash;“The church is simply like one of
the Arabian Nights, with its magnificent background
of mountains, which are as high as Caraiman. I have
rarely seen such harmony of colour. I said to Lecomte&mdash;‘N’avez-vous
pas trop souffert pendant ces douze
ans, pour vous réjouir aujourd’hui?’ ‘J’ai travaillé
pour un idéal et maintenant que Votre Majesté est
contente, je tâcherai de ne plus souffrir.’ I was quite
overpowered when I entered the church, as also when
I saw my book carried out and kissed, and the Gospel
read out of it.</p>

<p>“Those were wonderful moments! During the communion
all the little bells which the stone doves carry in
their beaks began to tinkle in a light breeze, and the
church echoed during Charles’ speech as though it
were giving answer. More than 15,000 people had
assembled, mostly peasants in their costumes. They
rejoiced because I was dressed as they were. In the
afternoon they brought me an ovation. When I went
to fetch my Book of the Gospels I found the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
full of the common people. The Bishop carried it
out and placed himself before the door of the church
with it. I turned over the pages for the people, who
kissed my shoulders, arms, and hands, and crossing
themselves, blessed me and kissed the book. Women,
children, and soldiers all crowded around us in the
wonderful church door. Add to this the sunset, which
tinted the distant mountains violet and pink, the
nearer hills golden. Next year the railway will run
to Curtea de Arges, so that you can be there from
Bucharest in three hours. Then of course the posting
will come to an end, and all the peasants will no more
accompany us with their horses, which is so charming.”</p>

<p>Troublous times for the old as well as for the
new home of Queen Elizabeth now followed. The
King and Queen of Roumania had also hurried to
Berlin for the Emperor William’s ninetieth birthday, the
22nd of March 1887. The assembled people cheered
heartily and enthusiastically when the carriage drove up
to the Palace which brought the King and Queen of
Roumania to offer their congratulations. It was in
honour of the son of Hohenzollern, who had founded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
a kingdom in the East with a strong hand. It was
also in honour of Carmen Sylva, the royal poetess.</p>

<p>Not a year had passed when in the early morning
of the 9th of March 1888, the Emperor William
had passed from his eventful life to life eternal, strong
in his simple faith. Victorious in battle and moderate
in victory, the founder of the German Empire, the ideal
of a German Emperor, his death became an event in
the history of the world.</p>

<p>It was not God’s will that the Emperor Frederick III.
should reign long and gloriously. With a courage
which effaced all the glories of his victories on fields
of battle, he patiently bore the tortures of his illness
till the last moment when he departed this life!
Germany does not forget her hero, round whose brow
a double laurel-wreath is bound&mdash;that of the warrior
and the uncomplaining sufferer of cruel anguish!</p>

<p>The royal Roumanian pair had again come to Berlin
for the funeral of the Emperor. Circumstances did
not allow of their doing the last honours to the Emperor
Frederick. But all the reasonings of statesmen had
to retire to the background when, in the course of
the summer, a change of air became a necessity for
their Majesties, repeated attacks of fever having utterly
weakened them. In August 1888 King Carol went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
to take the waters of Gräfenberg for a short time,
whilst Queen Elizabeth was sent to Westerland-on-Sylt
on the North Sea.</p>

<p>Not as Queen of Roumania, but as “Carmen Sylva,”
was she enthusiastically received on her journey to
Sylt as soon as she was on German soil. She has
sung her songs and told her tales to the German
Fatherland, and now the German people crowded around
her and thanked her with hearty cheers!</p>

<p>In beautiful sunshine, her carriage hung with garlands,
and enthusiastically greeted by the crowd, Carmen
Sylva arrived at the station of Westerland, which
was gaily decorated with triumphal arches. The
Queen had taken the Villa Roth, near the Downs,
for herself and her suite. She desired her tent to
be erected at the most southern point of the neutral
shore, for there was the principal playground of the
children, and she, the children’s friend, wished to be
in the midst of them and their merry games.</p>

<p>The next day she writes to her mother&mdash;“The crowd
of children surrounded me already. There are children
from Berlin and Westphalia, Saxony and Styria, from
all parts of Germany. They have built me a fortress,
and I tell them fairy tales whilst they sit crowded
around me on the sand. I am like the ratcatcher of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
Hameln&mdash;all children run after me.” And so it continues,
day after day, for three weeks.</p>

<p>It was a lovely picture when, on each morning,
the children hurried down to the shore to ornament
the sand-hill on which the Queen was to take her
place with flowers, to throw flowers on her lap and
bestrew her path with them. She sat there like
a fairy queen, encircled by the children. Whichever
way she turned, her eyes rested on the eager eyes
of children and their joyful faces. A little fair-haired
child held her parasol over her whilst she read to
them, or told of the hills and rivers of Roumania
which she had turned into living pictures in her
fairy tales. The deep stillness of the children listening
with eager attention, was only broken by the sound
of the waves or the calls of the sea-gulls which were
poised overhead.</p>

<p>When the royal lady ascended the steep steps which
led from the shore of an evening, she walked alone,
only accompanied by the crowd of children, who carried
after her the numberless floral offerings which had been
showered upon her in her seat on the sand or in her
tent in the course of the day. Then the Queen often
followed the little path that led to the cemetery, that
“Home of the Homeless.” Here she decorated with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
choicest flowers those graves on whose cross only the
words “Stranded hither” were engraved, with the date.
After her departure from Sylt, the Queen had a slab of
granite placed opposite the entrance with a few verses
which point to the Home above, where all names shall
stand in the Book of Life.</p>

<p>Her departure from Westerland on the 18th of
September was quite touching. Queen Elizabeth had
won all hearts during her stay there. Many hundreds
of people had assembled at the station to get
a last sight of her. The road which led to her
garlanded carriage was bestrewn with leaves and
flowers, whilst grown up people and children stood
on each side. With grateful looks they offered her
the last flowers, and the Queen could only advance
one step at a time, as there were so many to take
leave of. Weeping children pressed to her and weeping
women kissed her hands. Enthusiastic cheers for
the royal poetess resounded as the train left the station,
and did not cease till it had entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>The people of Sylt have a superstition that if a
wreath is thrown into the sea whilst one is thinking
of loved ones who are absent, they will return one
day if the waves carry it back to the shore. When
the Queen was removed from their sight the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
had committed their wreaths to the foam-crowned
waves, and had dried their tears and shouted for joy
when the flowers were thrown up on the shore in
safety!</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>We will end our account of the royal poetess by
reminding our English readers that the Prince of Wales
paid a visit to Sinaia in October 1888. His Royal
Highness was delighted with the beauty of the place
and with the arrangements made, in the Queen’s
happiest vein, for his entertainment. Among these
may be mentioned an elaborate series of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tableaux
vivants</i>, prepared and executed, under the Queen’s personal
supervision, by members of her Majesty’s household,
and representing the thirteen letters contained
in Prince of Wales. The scenes were mostly from
Shakespeare, the last of all giving a vivid rendering
of the Tavern Scene from “Henry IV.,” in which
Falstaff recounts his exploits to the future victor of
Agincourt.</p>

<div class="tb p2 b2">* <span class="in1">* </span><span class="in1">* </span><span class="in1">* </span><span class="in1">*</span><span class="in1">*</span><span class="in1">*</span><span class="in1">*</span></div>

<p>We have learnt to know Carmen Sylva’s old and
new home, and have followed her through happy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
sorrowful days. We have seen that she has inherited
her rich treasures of heart and mind from noble ancestors.
Her enthusiastic love of nature and her
interest in all its phenomena does not belie her descent
from the princely family of Wied. She has a decided
gift for music, painting, and poetry, with a leaning
towards philosophical thought, as also an unbiassed
judgment and great modesty, notwithstanding the richness
of her creative fancy.</p>

<p>We have also gathered that the Queen has qualities
which she not only expresses in her poetry, but that
an ideal is carried out in her life. By means of this
all-pervading and elevating power which her Majesty
possesses, and with which she influences others, this
idea has been developed in her labours as a Princess
and as a Queen. As a woman, as a Princess, and as
a Queen, she is to be reckoned amongst the noblest
